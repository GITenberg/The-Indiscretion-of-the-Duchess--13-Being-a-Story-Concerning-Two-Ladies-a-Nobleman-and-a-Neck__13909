<p><span class="hide">I</span>n accordance with many most excellent
precedents, I might begin by claiming the sympathy due to an orphan
alone in the world. I might even summon my unguided childhood and
the absence of parental training to excuse my faults and extenuate
my indiscretions. But the sympathy which I should thus gain would
be achieved, I fear, by something very like false pretenses. For my
solitary state sat very lightly upon me&mdash;the sad events which
caused it being softened by the influence of time and
habit&mdash;and had the recommendation of leaving me, not only free
to manage my own life as I pleased, but also possessed of a
competence which added power to my freedom. And as to the
indiscretions&mdash;well, to speak it in all modesty and with a
becoming consciousness of human frailty, I think that the undoubted
indiscretions&mdash;that I may use no harder term&mdash;which were
committed in the course of a certain fortnight were not for the
most part of my doing or contriving. For throughout the
transactions which followed on my arrival in France, I was rather
the sport of circumstances than the originator of any scheme; and
the prominent part which I played was forced upon me, at first by
whimsical chance, and later on by the imperious calls made upon me
by the position into which I was thrust.</p>
<p>The same reason that absolves me from the need of excuse
deprives me of the claim to praise; and, looking back, I am content
to find nothing of which I need seriously be ashamed, and glad to
acknowledge that, although Fate chose to put me through some queer
paces, she was not in the end malevolent, and that, now the whole
thing is finished, I have no cause to complain of the ultimate
outcome of it. In saying that, I speak purely and solely for
myself. There is one other for whom I might perhaps venture to say
the same without undue presumption, but I will not; while for the
rest, it must suffice for me to record their fortunes, without
entering on the deep and grave questions which are apt to suggest
themselves to anyone who considers with a thoughtful mind the
characters and the lives of those with whom he is brought in
contact on his way through the world. The good in wicked folk, the
depths in shallow folk, the designs of haphazard minds, the
impulsive follies of the cunning&mdash;all these exist, to be dimly
discerned by any one of us, to be ignored by none save those who
are content to label a man with the name of one quality and ignore
all else in him, but to be traced, fully understood, and
intelligently shown forth only by the few who are gifted to read
and expound the secrets of human hearts. That is a gift beyond my
endowment, and fitted for a task too difficult for my hand.
Frankly, I did not, always and throughout, discern as clearly as I
could desire the springs on which the conduct of my fellow-actors
turned; and the account I have given of their feelings and their
motives must be accepted merely as my reading of them, and for
what, as such, it is worth. The actual facts speak for themselves.
Let each man read them as he will; and if he does not indorse all
my views, yet he will, I venture to think, be recompensed by a
story which even the greatest familiarity and long pondering has
not robbed of all its interest for me. But then I must admit that I
have reasons which no one else can have for following with avidity
every stage and every development in the drama, and for seeking to
discern now what at the time was dark and puzzling to me.</p>
<p>The thing began in the most ordinary way in the world&mdash;or
perhaps that is too strongly put. The beginning was ordinary
indeed, and tame, compared with the sequel. Yet even the beginning
had a flavor of the unusual about it, strong enough to startle a
man so used to a humdrum life and so unversed in anything out of
the common as I. Here, then, is the beginning:</p>
<p>One morning, as I sat smoking my after-breakfast cigar in my
rooms in St. James&rsquo; Street, my friend Gustave de Berensac
rushed in. His bright brown eyes were sparkling, his mustache
seemed twisted up more gayly and triumphantly than ever, and his
manner was redolent of high spirits. Yet it was a dull, somber,
misty morning, for all that the month was July and another day or
two would bring August. But Gustave was a merry fellow, though
always (as I had occasion to remember later on) within the limits
of becoming mirth&mdash;as to which, to be sure, there may be much
difference of opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; he cried, pointing at me. &ldquo;You are a
man of leisure, nothing keeps you here; yet you stay in this
<em>bouillon</em> of an atmosphere, with France only twenty miles
away over the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have fogs in France too,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But
whither tends your impassioned speech, my good friend? Have you got
leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave was at this time an extra secretary at the French
Embassy in London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave? Yes, I have leave&mdash;and, what is more, I have
a charming invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My congratulations,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An invitation which includes a friend,&rdquo; he
continued, sitting down. &ldquo;Ah, you smile! You mean that is
less interesting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man may smile and smile, and not be a villain,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I meant nothing of the sort. I smiled at your
exhilaration&mdash;nothing more, on the word of a moral
Englishman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave grimaced; then he waved his cigarette in the air,
exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is charming, my dear Gilbert!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The exhilaration is explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a word to be said against her,&rdquo; he
added hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not depress me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But why
should she invite me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t invite you; she invites me to
bring&mdash;anybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is <em>ennuy&eacute;e</em>, I
presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would not be, placed as she is? He is
inhuman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>M. le mari?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not so stupid, after all! He forbids her to see a
single soul; we must steal our visit, if we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is away, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind government has sent him on a special mission of
inquiry to Algeria. Three cheers for the government!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;When are you going to
approach the subject of who these people are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not trust my discernment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no! You are too charitable&mdash;to one half of
humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will tell you. She is a great friend of my
sister&rsquo;s&mdash;they were brought up in the same convent; she
is also a good comrade of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good comrade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it; for I, you know, suffer hopelessly
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Lady Cynthia still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still!&rdquo; echoed Gustave with a tragic air. But he
recovered in a moment. &ldquo;Lady Cynthia being, however, in
Switzerland, there is no reason why I should not go to
Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Normandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. It is there that the duchess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! The duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is residing in retirement in a small
<em>ch&acirc;teau</em>, alone save for my sister&rsquo;s
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a servant or two, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just right, a servant or two; for he is most
stingy to her (though not, they say, to everybody), and gives her
nothing when he is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money is a temptation, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, to have none is a greater!&rdquo; and
Gustave shook his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess of what?&rdquo; I asked patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have heard of her,&rdquo; he said, with a proud
smile. Evidently he thought that the lady was a trump card.
&ldquo;The Duchess of Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laid down my cigar, maintaining, however, a calm demeanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Gustave. &ldquo;You will come, my
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not deny that Gustave had a right to his little triumph;
for a year ago, when the duchess had visited England with her
husband, I had received an invitation to meet her at the Embassy.
Unhappily, the death of a relative (whom I had never seen)
occurring the day before, I had been obliged to post off to
Ireland, and pay proper respect by appearing at the funeral. When I
returned the duchess had gone, and Gustave had, half-ironically,
consoled my evident annoyance by telling me that he had given such
a description of me to his friend that she shared my sorrow, and
had left a polite message to that effect. That I was not much
consoled needs no saying. That I required consolation will appear
not unnatural when I say that the duchess was one of the most
brilliant and well-known persons in French society; yes, and
outside France also. For she was a cosmopolitan. Her father was
French, her mother American; and she had passed two or three years
in England before her marriage. She was very pretty, and, report
said, as witty as a pretty woman need be. Once she had been rich,
but the money was swallowed up by speculation; she and her father
(the mother was dead) were threatened with such reduction of means
as seemed to them penury; and the marriage with the duke had
speedily followed&mdash;the precise degree of unwillingness on the
part of Mlle. de Beville being a disputed point. Men said she was
forced into the marriage, women very much doubted it; the lady
herself gave no indication, and her father declared that the match
was one of affection. All this I had heard from common friends;
only a series of annoying accidents had prevented the more
interesting means of knowledge which acquaintance with the duchess
herself would have afforded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have always,&rdquo; said Gustave, &ldquo;wanted to
know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I relit my cigar and puffed thoughtfully. It was true that I had
rather wished to know her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My belief is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that though she
says &lsquo;anybody,&rsquo; she means you. She knows what friends
we are; she knows you are eager to be among her friends; she would
guess that I should ask you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I despise and hate a man who is not open to flattery: he is a
hard, morose, distrustful, cynical being, doubting the honesty of
his friends and the worth of his own self. I leant an ear to
Gustave&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What she would not guess,&rdquo; he said, throwing his
cigarette into the fireplace and rising to his feet, &ldquo;is that
you would refuse when I did ask you. What shall be the reason?
Shocked, are you? Or afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave spoke as though nothing could either shock or frighten
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely considering whether it will amuse
me,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;How long are we asked for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on diplomatic events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mission to Algeria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my hands in my pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should certainly be glad, my dear Gustave,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;to meet your sister again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take the boat for Cherbourg to-morrow evening!&rdquo;
he cried triumphantly, slapping me on the back. &ldquo;And, in my
sister&rsquo;s name, many thanks! I will make it clear to the
duchess why you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to make bad blood between them like that,&rdquo;
I laughed.</p>
<p>In fine, I was pleased to go; and, on reflection, there was no
reason why I should not go. I said as much to Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing that everybody is going out of town and the place
will be a desert in a week, I&rsquo;m certainly not wanted here
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And seeing that the duke is gone to Algeria, we certainly
are wanted there,&rdquo; said Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a man should go where he is wanted,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a man is wanted,&rdquo; said Gustave, &ldquo;where a
lady bids him come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;be impolite not to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be dastardly. Besides, think how you will enjoy
the memory of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The memory?&rdquo; I repeated, pausing in my eager walk
up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a sweet memory,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my friend, it is prodigiously unwise&mdash;for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. Lady Cynthia&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, content to indicate the shield that protected him.
But it was too late to draw back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be as unwise,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as it
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or as the duke is,&rdquo; put in Gustave, with a knowing
twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it is a plan as delightful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the duchess is,&rdquo; said Gustave.</p>
<p>And so, for all the excellent reasons which may be collected
from the foregoing conversation,&mdash;and if carefully tabulated
they would, I am persuaded, prove as numerous as weighty,&mdash;I
went.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he Aycons of Aycon Knoll have always
been a hard-headed, levelheaded race. We have had no enthusiasms,
few ambitions, no illusions, and not many scandals. We keep our
heads on our shoulders and our purses in our pockets. We do not
rise very high, but we have never sunk. We abide at the Knoll from
generation to generation, deeming our continued existence in itself
a service to the state and an honor to the house. We think more
highly of ourselves than we admit, and allow ourselves to smile
when we walk in to dinner behind the new nobility. We grow just a
little richer with every decade, and add a field or two to our
domains once in five years. The gaps made by falling rents we have
filled by judicious purchases of land near rising towns; and we
have no doubt that there lies before us a future as long and
prosperous as our past has been. We are not universally popular,
and we see in the fact a tribute to our valuable qualities.</p>
<p>I venture to mention these family virtues and characteristics
because it has been thought in some quarters that I displayed them
but to a very slight degree in the course of the expedition on
which I was now embarked. The impression is a mistaken one. As I
have said before, I did nothing that was not forced upon me. Any of
my ancestors would, I am sure, have done the same, had they chanced
to be thrown under similar circumstances into the society of Mme.
de Saint-Maclou and of the other persons whom I was privileged to
meet; and had those other persons happened to act in the manner in
which they did when I fell in with them.</p>
<p>Gustave maintained his gayety and good spirits unabated through
the trials of our voyage to Cherbourg. The mild mystery that
attended our excursion was highly to his taste. He insisted on our
coming without servants. He persuaded me to leave no address;
obliged to keep himself within touch of the Embassy, he directed
letters to be sent to Avranches, where, he explained, he could
procure them; for, as he thought it safe to disclose when a dozen
miles of sea separated us from the possibility of curious
listeners, the house to which we were bound stood about ten miles
distant from that town, in a retired and somewhat desolate bit of
country lining the seashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister says it is the most <em>triste</em> place in
the world,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but we shall change all that when
we arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to prevent our arriving very soon to relieve
Mlle. de Berensac&rsquo;s depression, for the middle of the next
day found us at Avranches, and we spent the afternoon wandering
about somewhat aimlessly and staring across the bay at the mass of
Mont St. Michel. Directly beneath us as we stood on the hill, and
lying in a straight line with the Mount, there was a large square
white house, on the very edge of the stretching sand. We were told
that it was a convent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the whole place is no livelier than one,&rdquo; said
I, yawning. &ldquo;My dear fellow, why don&rsquo;t we go
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is right for you to see this interesting town,&rdquo;
answered Gustave gravely, but with a merry gleam in his eye.
&ldquo;However, I have ordered a carriage, so be
patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock, when we have dined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to get there in the dark, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason is there against that?&rdquo; he asked,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said I; and I went to pack up my bag.</p>
<p>In my room I chanced to find a <em>femme-de-chambre</em>. To her
I put a question or two as to the gentry of the neighborhood. She
rattled me off a few distinguished names, and ended:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke of Saint-Maclou has also a small
<em>ch&acirc;teau</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he there now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess only, sir,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Ah,
they tell wonderful stories of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they? Pray, of what kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not to her harm, sir; or, at least, not exactly,
though to simple country-folk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national shrug was an appropriate ending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good man,&rdquo; she answered earnestly,
&ldquo;and a very clever man. He is very highly thought of at
Paris, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had hoped, secretly, to hear that he was a villain; but he was
a good man. It was a scurvy trick to play on a good man. Well,
there was no help for it. I packed my bag with some dawning
misgivings; the chambermaid, undisturbed by my presence, went on
rubbing the table with some strong-smelling furniture polish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; she observed, as though there had been
no pause, &ldquo;he gives much to the church and to the
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be repentance,&rdquo; said I, looking up with a
hopeful air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; cried I, with a smile,
&ldquo;hypocrisy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chambermaid&rsquo;s shake of her head refused to accept this
idea; but my conscience, fastening on it, found rest. I hesitated
no longer. The man was a cunning hypocrite. I would go on
cheerfully, secure that he deserved all the bamboozling which the
duchess and my friend Gustave might prepare for him.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, as Gustave had arranged, we started in a
heavy carriage drawn by two great white horses and driven by a
stolid fat hostler. Slowly we jogged along under the stars, St.
Michel being our continual companion on the right hand, as we
followed the road round the bay. When we had gone five or six
miles, we turned suddenly inland. There were banks on each side of
the road now, and we were going uphill; for rising out of the plain
there was a sudden low spur of higher ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the house at the top?&rdquo; I asked Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just under the top,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall walk,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The fact is, I had grown intolerably impatient of our slow jog,
which had now sunk to a walk.</p>
<p>We jumped out and strode on ahead, soon distancing our carriage,
and waking echoes with our merry talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather wonder they have not come to meet us,&rdquo;
said Gustave. &ldquo;See, there is the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden turn in the road had brought us in sight of it. It was
a rather small modern Gothic <em>ch&acirc;teau</em>. It nestled
comfortably below the hill, which rose very steeply immediately
behind it. The road along which we were approaching appeared to
afford the only access, and no other house was visible. But,
desolate as the spot certainly was, the house itself presented a
gay appearance, for there were lights in every window from ground
to roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to have company,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that she expects us,&rdquo; answered Gustave.
&ldquo;This illumination is in our honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said I, quickening my pace; and Gustave
burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would catch fire when once I got you
started!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice struck on my ear&mdash;a clear, pleasant
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he slow to catch fire, my dear Gustave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started. Gustave looked round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is she,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where is
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he slow to catch fire?&rdquo; asked the voice again.
&ldquo;Well, he has but just come near the flame&rdquo;&mdash;and a
laugh followed the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow to light is long to burn,&rdquo; said I, turning to
the bank on the left side of the road, for it was thence that the
voice came.</p>
<p>A moment later a little figure in white darted down into the
road, laughing and panting. She seized Gustave&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ran so hard to meet you!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you brought Claire with you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present your friend to me,&rdquo; commanded the duchess,
as though she had not heard his question.</p>
<p>Did I permit myself to guess at such things, I should have
guessed the duchess to be about twenty-five years old. She was not
tall; her hair was a dark brown, and the color in her cheeks rich
but subdued. She moved with extraordinary grace and agility, and
seemed never at rest. The one term of praise (if it be one, which I
sometimes incline to doubt) that I have never heard applied to her
is&mdash;dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most charming of you to come, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard so much of you, and you&rsquo;ll
be so terribly dull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With yourself, madame, and Mlle. de
Berensac&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you must say that!&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;But come along, supper is ready. How delightful to have
supper again! I&rsquo;m never in good enough spirits to have supper
when I&rsquo;m alone. You&rsquo;ll be terribly uncomfortable,
gentlemen. The whole household consists of an old man and five
women&mdash;counting myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they all&mdash;?&rdquo; began Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discreet?&rdquo; she asked, interrupting again.
&ldquo;Oh, they will not tell the truth! Never fear, my dear
Gustave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What news of the duke?&rdquo; asked he, as we began to
walk, the duchess stepping a little ahead of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the best,&rdquo; said she, with a nod over her
shoulder. &ldquo;None, you know. That&rsquo;s one of your proverbs,
Mr. Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even a proverb is true sometimes,&rdquo; I ventured to
remark.</p>
<p>We reached the house and passed through the door, which stood
wide open. Crossing the hall, we found ourselves in a small square
room, furnished with rose-colored hangings. Here supper was spread.
Gustave walked up to the table. The duchess flung herself into an
armchair. She had taken her handkerchief out of her pocket, and she
held it in front of her lips and seemed to be biting it. Her
eyebrows were raised, and her face displayed a comical mixture of
amusement and apprehension. A glance of her eyes at me invited me
to share the perilous jest, in which Gustave&rsquo;s demeanor
appeared to bear the chief part.</p>
<p>Gustave stood by the table, regarding it with a puzzled air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud,
counting the covers laid.</p>
<p>The duchess said nothing, but her eyebrows mounted a little
higher, till they almost reached her clustering hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three?&rdquo; repeated Gustave, in
unmistakable questioning. &ldquo;Does Claire remain
upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Appeal&mdash;amusement&mdash;fright&mdash;shame&mdash;triumph&mdash;chased
one another across the eyes of Mme. de Saint-Maclou: each made so
swift an appearance, so swift an exit, that they seemed to blend in
some peculiar personal emotion proper to the duchess and to no
other woman born. And she bit the handkerchief harder than ever.
For the life of me I couldn&rsquo;t help it; I began to laugh; the
duchess&rsquo; face disappeared altogether behind the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say Claire&rsquo;s not here?&rdquo; cried
Gustave, turning on her swiftly and accusingly.</p>
<p>The head behind the handkerchief was shaken, first timidly, then
more emphatically, and a stifled voice vouchsafed the news:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left three days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave and I looked at one another. There was a pause. At last
I drew a chair back from the table, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madame is ready&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess whisked her handkerchief away and sprang up. She
gave one look at Gustave&rsquo;s grave face, and then, bursting
into a merry laugh, caught me by the arm, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fun, Mr. Aycon? There&rsquo;s nobody but
me! Isn&rsquo;t it fun?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>The Unexpected that Always Happened.</h4>

<p><span class="hide">E</span>verything depends on the point of
view and is rich in varying aspects. A picture is sublime from one
corner of the room, a daub from another; a woman&rsquo;s full face
may be perfect, her profile a disappointment; above all, what you
admire in yourself becomes highly distasteful in your neighbor. The
moral is, I suppose, Tolerance; or if not that, something else
which has escaped me.</p>
<p>When the duchess said that &ldquo;it&rdquo;&mdash;by which she
meant the whole position of affairs&mdash;was &ldquo;fun,&rdquo; I
laughed; on the other hand, Gustave de Berensac, after one
astonished stare, walked to the hall door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my carriage?&rdquo; we heard him ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has started on the way back three, minutes ago,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir! The driver will gallop down the hill; he could not
be overtaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fortunate!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see,&rdquo; observed Mme. de Saint-Maclou,
&ldquo;that it makes all that difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed hurt at the serious way in which Gustave took her
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had told the truth, you wouldn&rsquo;t have
come,&rdquo; she said in justification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not another word is necessary,&rdquo; said I, with a
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us sup,&rdquo; said the duchess, and she took
the armchair at the head of the table.</p>
<p>We began to eat and drink, serving ourselves. Presently Gustave
entered, stood regarding us for a moment, and then flung himself
into the third chair and poured out a glass of wine. The duchess
took no notice of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mlle, de Berensac was called away?&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was called away,&rdquo; answered the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the duchess, her eyes again full of
complicated expressions. I laughed. Then she broke out in a
plaintive cry: &ldquo;Oh! were you ever
dying&mdash;dying&mdash;dying of weariness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave made no reply; the frown on his face persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;to wreck a
pleasant party for the sake of a fine distinction? The presence of
Mlle. de Berensac would have infinitely increased our pleasure; but
how would it have diminished our crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had known you sooner, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said the
duchess; &ldquo;then I needn&rsquo;t have asked him at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, but I was content with things as they were. The duchess
sat with the air of a child who has been told that she is naughty,
but declines to accept the statement. I was puzzled at the stern
morality exhibited by my friend Gustave. His next remark threw some
light on his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! if it became known, what would be
thought?&rdquo; he demanded suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one thinks of what is thought,&rdquo; said the duchess
with a shrug, &ldquo;one is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fool,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or&mdash;a
lover!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the duchess, a smile coming on her lips.
&ldquo;If it is that, I&rsquo;ll forgive you, my dear Gustave.
Whose good opinion do you fear to lose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I write,&rdquo; said Gustave, with a rhetorical gesture,
&ldquo;to say that I am going to the house of some friends to meet
my sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you write?&rdquo; we murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister writes to say she is not there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she writes?&rdquo; we murmured again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; asked the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Lady Cynthia Chillingdon,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is a trick&mdash;a device&mdash;a deceit!&rdquo;
continued poor Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was decidedly indiscreet of you to come,&rdquo; said
the duchess reprovingly. &ldquo;How was I to know about Lady
Cynthia? If I had known about Lady Cynthia, I would not have asked
you; I would have asked Mr. Aycon only. Or perhaps you also, Mr.
Aycon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am alone in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where has Claire gone to?&rdquo; asked Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris,&rdquo; pouted the duchess.</p>
<p>Gustave rose, flinging his napkin on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall follow her to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
suppose you&rsquo;ll go back to England, Gilbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Gustave left us, it was my unhesitating resolve to return to
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you must,&rdquo; said the duchess ruefully.
&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it exasperating? I had planned it all so
delightfully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had told the truth&mdash;&rdquo; began
Gustave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not have had a preacher to supper,&rdquo; said
the duchess sharply; then she fell to laughing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mlle. de Berensac irrecoverable?&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. She has gone to take her turn of attendance on
your rich old aunt, Gustave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think that there was a little malice in the duchess&rsquo; way
of saying this.</p>
<p>There seemed nothing more to be done. The duchess herself did
not propose to defy conventionality to the extent of inviting me to
stay. To do her justice, as soon as the inevitable was put before
her, she accepted it with good grace, and, after supper, busied
herself in discovering the time and manner in which her guests
might pursue their respective journeys. I may be flattering myself,
but I thought that she displayed a melancholy satisfaction on
discovering that Gustave de Berensac must leave at ten
o&rsquo;clock the next morning, whereas I should be left to kick my
heels in idleness at Cherbourg if I set out before five in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can spend the time <em>en route</em>,&rdquo; said
Gustave. &ldquo;It will be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess looked at me; I looked at the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Gustave,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are very
considerate. You could not do more if I also were in love with Lady
Cynthia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;if I were quite
unfit to be spoken to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my remaining till the afternoon will not weary the
duchess&mdash;&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess will endure it,&rdquo; said she, with a nod
and a smile.</p>
<p>Thus it was settled, a shake of the head conveying
Gustave&rsquo;s judgment. And soon after, Mme. de Saint-Maclou bade
us good-night. Tired with my journey, and (to tell the truth) a
little out of humor with my friend, I was not long in seeking my
bed. At the top of the stairs a group of three girls were
gossiping; one of them handed me a candle and flung open the door
of my room with a roguish smile on her broad good-tempered
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the greatest virtues of women,&rdquo; said I
pausing on the threshold, &ldquo;is fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are devoted to Mme. la Duchesse,&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another, hardly behind it, is discretion,&rdquo; I
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame inculcates it on us daily,&rdquo; said she. I took
out a napoleon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said I, placing the napoleon in the
girl&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;I am obliged for your kind attentions.
Good-night!&rdquo; and I shut the door on the sound of a pleased,
excited giggling. I love to hear such sounds; they make me laugh
myself, for joy that this old world, in spite of everything, holds
so much merriment; and to their jovial lullaby I fell asleep,</p>
<p>Moreover&mdash;the duchess teaching discretion! There can have
been nothing like it since Baby Charles and Steenie conversed
within the hearing of King James! But, then discretion has two
meanings&mdash;whereof the one is &ldquo;Do it not,&rdquo; and the
other &ldquo;Tell it not.&rdquo; Considering of this ambiguity, I
acquitted the duchess of hypocrisy.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning we got rid of my dear
friend Gustave de Berensac. Candor compels me to put the statement
in that form; for the gravity which had fallen upon him the night
before endured till the morning, and he did not flinch from
administering something very like a lecture to his hostess. His
last words were an invitation to me to get into the carriage and
start with him. When I suavely declined, he told me that I should
regret it. It comforts me to think that his prophecy, though more
than once within an ace of the most ample fulfillment, yet in the
end was set at naught by the events which followed.</p>
<p>Gustave rolled down the hill, the duchess sighed relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;we can enjoy ourselves fora
few hours, Mr. Aycon. And after that&mdash;solitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was really very sorry for the duchess. Evidently society and
gayety were necessary as food and air to her, and her churl of a
husband denied them. My opportunity was short, but I laid myself
out to make the most of it. I could give her nothing more than a
pleasant memory, but I determined to do that.</p>
<p>We spent the greater part of the day in a ramble through the
woods that lined the slopes of the hill behind the house; and all
through the hours the duchess chatted about herself, her life, her
family&mdash;and then about the duke. If the hints she gave were to
be trusted, her husband deserved little consideration at her hands,
and, at the worst, the plea of reprisal might offer some excuse for
her, if she had need of one. But she denied the need, and here I
was inclined to credit her. For with me, as with Gustave de
Berensac before the shadow of Lady Cynthia came between, she was,
most distinctly, a &ldquo;good comrade.&rdquo; Sentiment made no
appearance in our conversation, and, as the day ruthlessly wore on,
I regretted honestly that I must go in deference to a
conventionality which seemed, in this case at least&mdash;Heaven
forbid that I should indulge in general theories&mdash;to mask no
reality. Yet she was delightful by virtue of the vitality in her;
and the woods echoed again and again with our laughter.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock we returned sadly to the house, where the
merry girls busied themselves in preparing a repast for me. The
duchess insisted on sharing my meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go supperless to bed to-night,&rdquo; said she;
and we sat down glum as two children going back to school.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a commotion outside; the girls were talking
to one another in rapid eager tones. The duchess raised her head,
listening. Then she turned to me, asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hear what they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can distinguish nothing except &lsquo;Quick,
quick!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke the door was thrown open, and two rushed in, the
foremost saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, madame, again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the duchess, starting
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is true. Jean was out, snaring a rabbit, and
caught sight of the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What carriage? Whose carriage?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my husband&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the duchess, quite
calmly. &ldquo;It is a favorite trick of his to surprise us. But
Algeria! We thought we were safe with Algeria. He must travel
underground like a mole, Suzanne, or we should have
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one hears nothing here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;are we to do
with Mr. Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can solve that,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll see you!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;He
is but a half-mile off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Aycon could take the side-path,&rdquo; said the
duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke would see him before he reached it,&rdquo; said
the girl. &ldquo;He would be in sight for nearly fifty
yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I hide in the bushes?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate anything that looks suspicious,&rdquo; remarked
the duchess, still quite calm; &ldquo;and if he happened to see
you, it would look rather suspicious! And he has got eyes like a
cat&rsquo;s for anything of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no denying that it would look suspicious if I were
caught hiding in the bushes. I sat silent, having no other
suggestion to make.</p>
<p>Suzanne, with a readiness not born, I hope, of practice, came to
the rescue with a clever suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English groom whom madame dismissed a week
ago&mdash;&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Why should not the gentleman
pass as the groom? The man would not take his old clothes away, for
he had bought new ones, and they are still here. The gentleman
would put them on and walk
past&mdash;<em>voil&agrave;</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you look like a groom?&rdquo; asked the duchess.
&ldquo;If he speaks to you, make your French just a <em>little</em>
worse&rdquo;&mdash;and she smiled.</p>
<p>They were all so calm and businesslike that it would have seemed
disobliging and absurd to make difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can send your luggage soon, you know,&rdquo; said the
duchess. &ldquo;You had better hide Mr. Aycon&rsquo;s luggage in
your room, Suzanne. Really, I am afraid you ought to be getting
ready, Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The point of view again! By virtue of the duchess&rsquo;
calmness and Suzanne&rsquo;s cool readiness, the proceeding seemed
a most ordinary one. Five minutes later I presented myself to the
duchess, dressed in a villainous suit of clothes, rather too tight
for me, and wearing a bad hat rakishly cocked over one eye. The
duchess surveyed me with great curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately the duke is not a very clever man,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Oh, by the way, your name&rsquo;s George Sampson,
and you come from Newmarket; and you are leaving because you took
more to drink than was good for you. Good-by, Mr. Aycon. I do hope
that we shall meet again under pleasanter circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could not be pleasanter&mdash;but they might be more
prolonged,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so good of you to come,&rdquo; she said, pressing
my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carriage is but a quarter of a mile off!&rdquo; cried
Suzanne warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very annoying it is! I wish to Heaven the Algerians
had eaten the duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not forget my day here,&rdquo; I assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t? It&rsquo;s charming of you. Oh, how dull
it will be now! It only wanted the arrival of&mdash;Well,
good-by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a final and long pressure of the duchess&rsquo; hand,
I, in the garb and personality of George Sampson, dismissed for
drunkenness, walked out of the gate of the
<em>ch&acirc;teau</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; I observed to myself as I started,
&ldquo;would seem highly probable&mdash;and that is, that this sort
of thing has happened before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea did not please me. I like to do things first.</p>

<div class="dropcap"><img src="images/04dc.png" alt="I" id=
"img04dc" name="img04dc" width="100%" /></div>
<p><span class="hide">I</span> walked on at a leisurely pace; the
heavy carriage was very near the top of the hill. In about three
minutes&rsquo; time we met. There sat alone in the carriage a tall
dark man, with a puffy white face, a heavy mustache, and stern cold
eyes. He was smoking a cigar. I plucked my hat from my head and
made as if to pass by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he called out, stopping the
carriage.</p>
<p>I began to recite my lesson in stumbling French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you? Oh, you&rsquo;re English! Then in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, speak English&mdash;not that gabble.&rdquo;
And then he repeated his order, &ldquo;Speak English,&rdquo; in
English, and continued in that language, which he spoke with stiff
formal correctness.</p>
<p>He heard my account of myself with unmoved face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any writings&mdash;any testimonials?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; I stammered, addressing him in style
I thought most natural to my assumed character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little curious, isn&rsquo;t it? You become
intoxicated everywhere, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been intoxicated in my life, my
lord,&rdquo; said I, humbly but firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you dispute the justice of your
dismissal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo; I thought such protest due to my
original.</p>
<p>He looked at me closely, smoking his cigar the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made love to the chambermaids?&rdquo; he asked
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord. One evening, my lord, it was very hot,
and&mdash;and the wine, my lord&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were intoxicated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fumbled with my hat, praying that the fellow would move
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What servants are there?&rdquo; he asked, pointing to the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four maids, my lord, and old Jean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he meditated; then he said sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever waited at table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have all, I suppose, waited at table&mdash;in one sense.
Perhaps that may save my remark from untruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now and then, my lord,&rdquo; I answered, wondering what
he would be at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have guests arriving to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;My man comes with them, but the work will perhaps be too
much for him. Are you willing to stay and help? I will pay you the
same wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have laughed in his face; but duty seemed to point to
seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, my lord&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, have you got another place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord; not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get up on the front seat. Or do you want your
employers to say you are disobliging as well as drunken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the lady sent me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave that to me. Come, jump up! Don&rsquo;t keep
me waiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtfully I stood in the road, the duke glaring at me with
impatient anger. Then he leaned forward and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are curiously reluctant, sir, to earn your living. I
don&rsquo;t understand it. I must make some inquiries about
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I detected suspicion dawning in his eyes. He was a great man; I
did not know what hindrances he might not be able to put in the way
of my disappearance. And what would happen if he made his
inquiries? Inquiries might mean searching, and I carried a passport
in the name of Gilbert Aycon.</p>
<p>Such share had prudence; the rest must be put down to the sudden
impulse of amusement which seized me. It was but for a day or two!
Then I could steal away. Meanwhile what would not the face of the
duchess say, when I rode up on the front seat!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was afraid I should not give
satisfaction,&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I take
you from necessity, not choice, my friend. Up with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I got up beside the driver&mdash;not, luckily, the one who
had brought Gustave de Berensac and myself the day before&mdash;and
the carriage resumed its slow climb up the hill.</p>
<p>We stopped at the door. I jumped down and assisted my new
master.</p>
<p>The door was shut. Nobody was to be seen; evidently we were not
expected. The duke smiled sardonically, opened the door and walked
in, I just behind. Suzanne was sweeping the floor. With one glance
at the duke and myself, she sprang back, with a cry of most genuine
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re mighty surprised, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; sneered the duke. &ldquo;Old Jean didn&rsquo;t scuttle
away to tell you then? You keep a good watch, young woman. Your
mistress&rsquo; orders, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Suzanne stared&mdash;and at me. The duke chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s back again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so you
must make the best of it, my girl. Where&rsquo;s the
duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in&mdash;in her sitting-room, M. le
Duc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In&mdash;in&mdash;in,&rsquo;&rdquo; he echoed
mockingly. Then he stepped swiftly across the hall and flung the
door suddenly open. I believe he thought that he really had
surprised Jean&rsquo;s slow aged scamper ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence for your life!&rdquo; I had time to whisper to
Suzanne; and then I followed him. There might be more
&ldquo;fun&rdquo; to come.</p>
<p>The duchess was sitting with a book in her hand. I was
half-hidden by the duke, and she did not see me. She looked up,
smiled, yawned, and held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly expected you, Armand,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
thought you were in Algeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anybody would have been annoyed; there is no doubt that the Duke
of Saint-Maclou was very much annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem overjoyed at the surprise,&rdquo;
said he gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always surprising me,&rdquo; she answered,
lifting her eyebrows.</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned round, saying &ldquo;Sampson!&rdquo; and then
turned to her, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another old friend for you.&rdquo; And he
seized me by the shoulder and pulled me into the room.</p>
<p>The duchess sprang to her feet, crying out in startled tones,
&ldquo;Back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept my eyes glued to the floor, wondering what would happen
next, thinking that it would be, likely enough, a personal conflict
with my master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, back,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am sorry, madame, if
it is not your pleasure, for it chances to be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sneer gave the duchess a moment&rsquo;s time. I felt her
regarding me, and I looked up cautiously. The duke still stood half
a pace in front of me, and the message of my glance sped past him
unperceived.</p>
<p>Then came what I had looked for&mdash;the gradual dawning of the
position on the duchess, and the reflection of that dawning light
in those wonderful eyes of hers. She clasped her hands, and drew in
her breath in a long &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; It spoke utter amusement and
delight. What would the duke make of it? He did not know what to
make of it, and glared at her in angry bewilderment. Her quick wit
saw the blunder she had been betrayed into. She said
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; again, but this time it expressed nothing except
a sense of insult and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that man here for?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have engaged him to assist my
household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had dismissed him,&rdquo; she said haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must beg you to postpone the execution of your
decree,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have need of a servant, and I have
no time to find another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What need is there of another? Is not Lafleur
here?&rdquo; (She was playing her part well now.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lafleur comes to-morrow; but he will not be
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough&mdash;for you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our party will be larger to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More surprises?&rdquo; she asked, sinking back into her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be a surprise that I should invite my friends to my
house,&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you should not consult your wife,&rdquo; she
said, with a smile.</p>
<p>He turned to me, bethinking himself, I suppose, that the
conversation was not best suited for the ears of the groom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and join your fellow-servants; and see that you behave
yourself this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed and was about to withdraw, when the duchess motioned me
to stop. For an instant her eyes rested on mine. Then she said, in
gentle tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, Sampson, that the duke thinks it safe to give
you an opportunity of retrieving your character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That for his character!&rdquo; said the duke, snapping
his fingers. &ldquo;I want him to help when Mme. and Mlle. Delhasse
are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the words the duchess went red in the face, and then white,
and sprang up, declaring aloud in resolute, angry tones, that
witnessed the depth of her feelings in the matter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not receive Mlle. Delhasse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was glad I had not missed that: it was a new aspect of my
little friend the duchess. Alas, my pleasure was short-lived! for
the duke, his face full of passion, pointed to the door, saying
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; and, cursing his regard for the dignity of the
family, I went.</p>
<p>In the hall I paused. At first I saw nobody. Presently a rosy,
beaming face peered at me over the baluster halfway up the stairs,
and Suzanne stole cautiously down, her finger on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does it mean, sir?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the duke takes me
for the dismissed groom&mdash;and has re-engaged me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve come?&rdquo; she cried softly, clasping
her hands in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it appear so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going to stay, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s another matter. But&mdash;for the
moment, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not&mdash;in such good company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does madame know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she knows, Suzanne. Come, show me the way to my
quarters; and no more &lsquo;sir&rsquo; just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were standing by the stairs. I looked up and saw the other
girls clustered on the landing above us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and tell them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Warn them to show
no surprise. Then come back and show me the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suzanne, her mirth half-startled out of her but yet asserting
its existence in dimples round her mouth, went on her errand. I
leaned against the lowest baluster and waited.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door of the duchess&rsquo; room was flung open and
she came out. She stood for an instant on the threshold. She turned
toward the interior of the room and she stamped her foot on the
parqueted floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she said passionately, and
flung the door close behind her, to the accompaniment of a harsh,
scornful laugh.</p>
<p>Involuntarily I sprang forward to meet her. But she was better
on her guard than I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but I must see you
soon&mdash;this evening&mdash;after dinner. Suzanne will arrange
it. You must help me, Mr. Aycon; I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my power!&rdquo; I whispered, and with a glance
of thanks she sped upstairs. I saw her stop and speak to the group
of girls, talking to them in an eager whisper. Then, followed by
two of them, she pursued her way upstairs.</p>
<p>Suzanne came down and approached me, saying simply,
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and led the way toward the servants&rsquo;
quarters. I followed her, smiling; I was about to make acquaintance
with a new side of life.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time I was wondering who Mlle. Delhasse might
chance to be: the name seemed familiar to me, and yet for the
moment I could not trace it. And then I slapped my thigh in the
impulse of my discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Marie Delhasse the singer!&rdquo; cried I, in
English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, sir, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be quiet!&rdquo;
whispered Suzanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly right,&rdquo; said I, with a nod of
approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the pantry,&rdquo; said Suzanne, for all the
world as though nothing had happened. &ldquo;And in that cupboard
you will find Sampson&rsquo;s livery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a pretty one?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, sir, will look well in it,&rdquo; said she, with
that delicate evasive flattery that I love. &ldquo;Would not you,
sir, look well in anything?&rdquo; she meant.</p>
<p>And while I changed my traveling suit for the livery, I
remembered more about Marie Delhasse, and, among other things, that
the Duke of Saint-Maclou was rumored to be her most persistent
admirer. Some said that she favored him; others denied it with more
or less conviction and indignation. But, whatever might chance to
be the truth about that, it was plain that the duchess had
something to say for herself when she declined to receive the lady.
Her refusal was no idle freak, but a fixed determination, to which
she would probably adhere. And, in fact, adhere to it she did, even
under some considerable changes of circumstance.</p>

<h4>A Strategic Retreat.</h4>

<div class="dropcap"><img src="images/05dc.png" alt="T" id=

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he arrival of the duke, aided perhaps
by his bearing toward his wife and toward me, had a somewhat
curious effect on me. I will not say that I felt at liberty to fall
in love with the duchess; but I felt the chain of honor, which had
hitherto bound me from taking any advantage of her indiscretion,
growing weaker; and I also perceived the possibility of my
inclinations beginning to strain on the weakened chain. On this
account, among others, I resolved, as I sat in the pantry drinking
a glass of wine with which Suzanne kindly provided me, that my
sojourn in the duke&rsquo;s household should be of the shortest.
Moreover, I was not amused; I was not a real groom; the maids
treated me with greater distance and deference than before; I lost
the entertainment of upstairs, and did not gain the interest of
downstairs. The absurd position must be ended. I would hear what
the duchess wanted of me; then I would go, leaving Lafleur to
grapple with his increased labors as best he could. True, I should
miss Marie Delhasse. Well, young men are foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said I to myself with a sigh,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not wait at table that night; the duchess was shut up in
her own apartment: the duke took nothing but an omelette and a cup
of coffee; these finished, he summoned Suzanne and her assistants
to attend him on the bedroom floor, and I heard him giving
directions for the lodging of the expected guests. Apparently they
were to be received, although the duchess would not receive them.
Not knowing what to make of that situation, I walked out into the
garden and lit my pipe; I had clung to that in spite of my change
of raiment.</p>
<p>Presently Suzanne looked out. A call from the duke proclaimed
that she had stolen a moment. She nodded, pointed to the narrow
gravel path which led into the shrubbery, and hastily withdrew. I
understood, and strolled carelessly along the path till I reached
the shrubbery. There another little path, running nearly at right
angles to that by which I had come, opened before me. I strolled
some little way along, and finding myself entirely hidden from the
house by the intervening trees, I sat down on a rude wooden bench
to wait patiently till I should be wanted. For the duchess I should
have had to wait some time, but for company I did not wait long;
after about ten minutes I perceived a small, spare,
dark-complexioned man coming along the path toward me and toward
the house. He must have made a short cut from the road, escaping
the winding of the carriage-way. He wore decent but rather shabby
clothes, and carried a small valise in his hand. Stopping opposite
to me, he raised his hat and seemed to scan my neat blue
brass-buttoned coat and white cords with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong to the household of the duke, sir?&rdquo; he
asked, with a polite lift of his hat.</p>
<p>I explained that I did&mdash;for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think of leaving, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;as soon as I can; I am only
engaged for the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not happen to know, sir, if the duke requires a
well-qualified indoor servant? I should be most grateful if you
would present me to him. I heard in Paris that a servant had left
him; but he started so suddenly that I could not get access to him,
and I have followed him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly what he does want, I believe,
sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If I were you, I would go to the house
and obtain entrance. The duke expects guests to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yourself, sir? Are not your services sufficient for
the present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you perceive,&rdquo; said I, indicating my attire,
&ldquo;I am not an indoor servant. I am but a makeshift in that
capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled a polite remonstrance at my modesty, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think, then, I might have a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An excellent one, I believe. Turn to the left, there by
the chestnut tree, and you will find yourself within a
minute&rsquo;s walk of the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, raised his hat, and trotted off, moving with a quick,
shuffling, short-stepping gait. I lit another pipe and yawned. I
hoped the duke would engage this newcomer and let me go about my
business; and I fancied that he would, for the fellow looked
dapper, sharp, and handy. And the duchess? I was so disturbed to
find myself disturbed at the thought of the duchess that I
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;d better go! By Jove, I had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wishing-cap, or rather a hoping-cap&mdash;for if a man who is
no philosopher may have an opinion, we do not always wish and hope
for the same thing&mdash;could have done no more for me than the
chance of Fate; for at the moment the duke&rsquo;s voice called
&ldquo;Sampson!&rdquo; loudly from the house. I ran in obedience to
his summons. He stood in the porch with the little stranger by him;
and the stranger wore a deferential, but extremely well-satisfied
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you,&rdquo; said the duke to me, &ldquo;you can
make yourself scarce as soon as you like. I&rsquo;ve got a better
servant, aye, and a sober one. There&rsquo;s ten francs for you.
Now be off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt it incumbent on me to appear a little aggrieved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to go to-night?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Where can I
get to to-night, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that to me? I dare say if you stand old Jean
a franc, he&rsquo;ll give you a lift to the nearest inn. Tell him
he may take a farm-horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really the duke was treating me with quite as much civility as I
have seen many of my friends extend to their servants. I had
nothing to complain of. I bowed, and was about to turn away, when
the duchess appeared in the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Armand?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You are
sending Sampson away after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not deny your request,&rdquo; said he in mockery.
&ldquo;Moreover, I have found a better servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger almost swept the ground in obeisance before the
lady of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very changeable,&rdquo; said the duchess.</p>
<p>I saw vexation in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, your sex cannot have a monopoly of change. I
change a bad servant&mdash;as you yourself think him&mdash;for a
good one. Is that remarkable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess said not another word, but turned into the house and
disappeared. The duke followed her. The stranger, with a bow to me,
followed him. I was left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I am not wanted,&rdquo; said I to myself; and,
having arrived at this conclusion, I sought out old Jean. The old
fellow was only too ready to drive me to Avranches or anywhere else
for five francs, and was soon busy putting his horse in the shafts.
I sought out Suzanne, got her to smuggle my luggage downstairs,
gave her a parting present, took off my livery and put on the
groom&rsquo;s old suit, and was ready to leave the house of M. de
Saint-Maclou.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock my short servitude ended. As soon as a
bend in the road hid us from the house I opened my portmanteau, got
out my own clothes, and, <em>sub &aelig;there</em>, changed my
raiment, putting on a quiet suit of blue, and presenting George
Sampson&rsquo;s rather obtrusive garments (which I took the liberty
of regarding as a perquisite) to Jean, who received them gladly. I
felt at once a different being&mdash;so true it is that the tailor
makes the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are well out of that,&rdquo; grunted old Jean.
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d discovered you, he&rsquo;d have had you out
and shot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>!&rdquo; said Jean with an
expressiveness which was a little disquieting; for it was on the
cards that the duke might still find me out. And I was not a
practiced shot&mdash;not at my fellow-men, I mean. Suddenly I
leaped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I forgot! The
duchess wanted me. Stop, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a jerk Jean pulled up his horse, and gazed at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go back like that,&rdquo; he said, with a
grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to put on these clothes
again,&rdquo; and he pointed to the discarded suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very nearly forgot the duchess,&rdquo; said I. To tell
the truth, I was at first rather proud of my forgetfulness; it
argued a complete triumph over that unruly impulse at which I have
hinted. But it also smote me with remorse. I leaped to the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait while I run back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will shoot you after all,&rdquo; grinned Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil take him!&rdquo; said I, picturing the poor
duchess utterly forsaken&mdash;at the mercy of Delhasses, husband,
and what not.</p>
<p>I declare, as my deliberate opinion, that there is nothing more
dangerous than for a man almost to forget a lady who has shown him
favor. If he can quite forget her&mdash;and will be so
unromantic&mdash;why, let him, and perhaps small harm done. But
almost&mdash;That leaves him at the mercy of every generous
self-reproach. He is ready to do anything to prove that she was
every second in his memory.</p>
<p>I began to retrace my steps toward the
<em>ch&acirc;teau</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall get the sack over this!&rdquo; called Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall come to no harm by that, if you do,&rdquo; I
assured him.</p>
<p>But hardly had I&mdash;my virtuous pride now completely
smothered by my tender remorse&mdash;started on my ill-considered
return journey, when, just as had happened to Gustave de Berensac
and myself the evening before, a slim figure ran down from the bank
by the roadside. It was the duchess. The short cut had served her.
She was hardly out of breath this time; and she appeared composed
and in good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought for a moment you&rsquo;d forgotten me, but I
knew you wouldn&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could I resist such trust?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget you, madame?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I would as
soon forget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I knew you&rsquo;d wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, waiting faithfully,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the duchess. &ldquo;Take
this, please, Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&rdquo; was a small handbag. She gave it to me, and
began to walk toward the cart, where Jean was placidly smoking a
long black cheroot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to speak to me?&rdquo; I suggested, as I
walked by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; said the duchess, reaching the cart,
&ldquo;as we go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Jean took his cheroot from his lips. I jumped back two
paces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;As we go
along, did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be better,&rdquo; said the duchess, getting into
the cart (unassisted by me, I am sorry to say). &ldquo;Because he
may find out I&rsquo;m gone, and come after us, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing seemed more likely; I was bound to admit that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; continued the duchess. And then
she suddenly began to talk English. &ldquo;I told him I
shouldn&rsquo;t stay in the house if Mlle. Delhasse came. He
didn&rsquo;t believe me; well, he&rsquo;ll see now. I
couldn&rsquo;t stay, could I? Why don&rsquo;t you get
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half dazed, I got in. I offered no opinion on the question of
Mlle. Delhasse: to begin with, I knew very little about it; in the
second place there seemed to me to be a more pressing question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Jean!&rdquo; said the duchess.</p>
<p>And we lumbered on at a trot, Jean twisting his cheroot round
and round, and grunting now and again. The old man&rsquo;s face
said, plain as words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall get the sack; and you&rsquo;ll be
shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found my tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this what you wanted me for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the duchess, speaking French
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t come with me!&rdquo; I cried in
unfeigned horror.</p>
<p>The duchess looked up; she fixed her eyes on me for a moment;
her eyes grew round, her brows lifted. Then her lips curved: she
blushed very red; and she burst into the merriest fit of
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; laughed the duchess. &ldquo;Oh, what
fun, Mr. Aycon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me rather a serious matter,&rdquo; I ventured
to observe. &ldquo;Leaving out all question of&mdash;of
what&rsquo;s correct, you know&rdquo; (I became very apologetic at
this point), &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a little risky, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean evidently thought so; he nodded solemnly over his
cheroot.</p>
<p>The duchess still laughed; indeed, she was wiping her eyes with
her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an opinion to have of me!&rdquo; she gasped at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming with you, Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dare say my face showed relief: I don&rsquo;t know that I need
be ashamed of that. My change of expression, however, set the
duchess a-laughing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a man look so glad,&rdquo; said she gayly.
Yet somewhere, lurking in the recesses of her tone&mdash;or was it
of her eyes?&mdash;there was a little reproach, a little challenge.
And suddenly I felt less glad: a change of feeling which I do not
seek to defend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where are you going?&rdquo; I asked in much
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said the duchess, assuming in a moment
a most serious air, &ldquo;into religious retirement for a few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religious retirement?&rdquo; I echoed in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking it&rsquo;s not my
<em>m&eacute;tier</em>?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes gleaming
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there, to be sure.&rdquo; And she pointed to where
the square white convent stood on the edge of the bay, under the
hill of Avranches. &ldquo;There, at the convent. The Mother
Superior is my friend, and will protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess spoke as though the guillotine were being prepared
for her. I sat silent. The situation was becoming rather too
complicated for my understanding. Unfortunately, however, it was to
become more complicated still; for the duchess, turning to the
English tongue again, laid a hand on my arm and said in her most
coaxing tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, my dear Mr. Aycon, are going to stay a few days
in Avranches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an hour!&rdquo; would have expressed the resolve of
my intellect. But we are not all intellect; and what I actually
said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;I want you, Mr.
Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will stay,&rdquo; said I, nodding, &ldquo;just a few
days at Avranches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were within half a mile of that town. The convent gleamed
white in the moonlight about three hundred yards to the left. The
duchess took her little bag, jumped lightly down, kissed her hand
to me, and walked off.</p>
<p>Jean had made no comment at all&mdash;the duchess&rsquo;
household was hard to surprise. I could make none. And we drove in
silence into Avranches.</p>
<p>When there before with Gustave, I had put up at a small inn at
the foot of the hill. Now I drove up to the summit and stopped
before the principal hotel. A waiter ran out, cast a curious glance
at my conveyance, and lifted my luggage down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know if you get into any trouble for being
late,&rdquo; said I to Jean, giving him another five francs.</p>
<p>He nodded and drove off, still chewing the stump of his
cheroot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have a room?&rdquo; I asked, turning to the
waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; said he, catching up my bag in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;from Mont St.
Michel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curious expression spread over the waiter&rsquo;s face. I
fancy he knew old Jean and the cart by sight; but he spread out his
hands and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he with the incomparable courtesy
of the French nation, &ldquo;has come from wherever monsieur
pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said I, giving him a trifle, &ldquo;is an
excellent understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I walked into the <em>salle-&agrave;-manger</em>, and
almost into the arms of an extraordinarily handsome girl who was
standing just inside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really an eventful day,&rdquo; I thought to
myself.</p>

<p><span class="hide">O</span>ccurrences such as this induce in a
man of imagination a sense of sudden shy intimacy. The physical
encounter seems to typify and foreshadow some intermingling of
destiny. This occurs with peculiar force when the lady is as
beautiful as was the girl I saw before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame,&rdquo; said I, with a whirl of
my hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the lady, with an
inclination of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is so careless in entering rooms hurriedly,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it is stupid to stand just by the door!&rdquo;
insisted the lady.</p>
<p>Conscious that she was scanning my appearance, I could but
return the compliment. She was very tall, almost as tall as I was
myself; you would choose to call her stately, rather than slender.
She was very fair, with large lazy blue eyes and a lazy smile to
match. In all respects she was the greatest contrast to the Duchess
of Saint-Maclou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were about to pass out?&rdquo; said I, holding the
door.</p>
<p>She bowed; but at the moment another lady&mdash;elderly, rather
stout, and, to speak it plainly, of homely and unattractive
aspect&mdash;whom I had not hitherto perceived, called from a table
at the other end of the room where she was sitting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to start early to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger lady turned her head slowly toward the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I never start
early. Besides, this town is interesting&mdash;the landlord says
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he wishes us to arrive for
<em>d&eacute;jeuner</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take it here. Perhaps we will drive over in the
afternoon&mdash;perhaps the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young lady gazed at her mother with an air of
indifference&mdash;or rather it seemed to me strangely like one of
aversion and defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; cried the elder in consternation.
&ldquo;My dearest Marie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just as I thought,&rdquo; said I to myself
complacently.</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse&mdash;for beyond doubt it was she&mdash;walked
slowly across the room and sat down by her mother. I took a table
nearer the door; the waiter appeared, and I ordered a light supper.
Marie poured out a glass of wine from a bottle on the table;
apparently they had been supping. They began to converse together
in low tones. My repast arriving, I fell to. A few moments later, I
heard Marie say, in her composed indolent tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I shall go at all. <em>Entre
nous</em>, he bores me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stole a glance at Mme. Delhasse. Consternation was writ large
on her face, and suspicion besides. She gave her daughter a quick
sidelong glance, and a frown gathered on her brow. So far as I
heard, however, she attempted no remonstrance. She rose, wrapping a
shawl round her, and made for the door. I sprang up and opened it;
she walked out. Marie drew a chair to the fire and sat down with
her back to me, toasting her feet&mdash;for the summer night had
turned chilly. I finished my supper. The clock struck half-past
eleven. I stifled a yawn; one smoke and then to the bed was my
programme.</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse turned her head half-round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;let me prevent you
having your cigarette. I should set you at ease by going to bed,
but I can&rsquo;t sleep so early, and upstairs the fire is not
lighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked her and approached the fire. She was gazing into it
meditatively. Presently she looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke, sir,&rdquo; she said imperiously but
languidly.</p>
<p>I obeyed her, and stood looking down at her, admiring her
stately beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have passed the day here?&rdquo; she asked, gazing
again into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this neighborhood,&rdquo; said I, with discreet
vagueness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been able to pass the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; That had not been my
difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is, of course,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;Mont
St. Michel. But can you imagine anyone living in such a
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless Fate set one here&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to make a stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;on my way
to&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was scrutinizing her closely now, for her manner seemed to
witness more than indolence; irresolution, vacillation, discomfort,
asserted their presence. I could not make her out, but her languid
indifference appeared more assumed than real.</p>
<p>With another upward glance, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Marie Delhasse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a well-known name,&rdquo; said I with a bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked quickly, wheeling half-round and
facing me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you are a great singer,&rdquo; I answered
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m not all voice! What about me? A woman is
more than an organ pipe. What about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her excitement contrasted with the langour she had displayed
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said I, wondering that she should ask a
stranger such a question. She glanced at me for an instant. I threw
my eyes up to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; she said quietly; but the trembling
of her hands belied her composure.</p>
<p>The tawdry gilt clock on the mantelpiece by me ticked through a
long silence. The last act of the day&rsquo;s comedy seemed set for
a more serious scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask a stranger a question like that?&rdquo; I
said at last, giving utterance to the thought that puzzled me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom should I ask? And I like your face&mdash;no, not
because it is handsome. You are English, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am English. My name is Gilbert Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aycon&mdash;Aycon! It is a little difficult to say it as
you say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her thoughts claimed her again. I threw my cigarette into the
fire, and stood waiting her pleasure. But she seemed to have no
more to say, for she rose from the seat and held out her hand to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you &lsquo;shake hands?&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, the
last two words in English; and she smiled again.</p>
<p>I hastened to do as she asked me, and she moved toward the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall see you
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be here.&rdquo; Then I added: &ldquo;I could not
help hearing you talk of moving elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood still in the middle of the room; she opened her lips
to speak, shut them again, and ended by saying nothing more
than:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we talked of it. My mother wishes it. Good-night,
Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bade her good-night, and she passed slowly through the door,
which I closed behind her. I turned again to the fire, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would the duchess think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not even know what I thought of it myself; of one thing
only I felt sure&mdash;-that what I had heard of Marie Delhasse was
not all that there was to learn about her.</p>
<p>I was lodged in a large room on the third floor, and when I
awoke the bright sun beamed on the convent where, as I presume,
Mme. de Saint-Maclou lay, and on the great Mount beyond it in the
distance. I have never risen with a more lively sense of unknown
possibilities in the day before me. These two women who had
suddenly crossed my path, and their relations to the pale
puffy-cheeked man at the little <em>ch&acirc;teau</em>, might well
produce results more startling than had seemed to be offered even
by such a freak as the original expedition undertaken by Gustave de
Berensac and me. And now Gustave had fallen away and I was left to
face the thing alone. For face it I must. My promise to the duchess
bound me: had it not I doubt whether I should have gone; for my
interest was not only in the duchess.</p>
<p>I had my coffee upstairs, and then, putting on my hat, went down
for a stroll. So long as the duke did not come to Avranches, I
could show my face boldly&mdash;and was not he busy preparing for
his guests? I crossed the threshold of the hotel.</p>
<p>Just at the entrance stood Marie Delhasse; opposite her was a
thickset fellow, neatly dressed and wearing mutton-chop whiskers.
As I came out I raised my hat. The man appeared not to notice me,
though his eyes fell on me for a moment. I passed quickly
by&mdash;in fact, as quickly as I could&mdash;for it struck me at
once that this man must be Lafleur, and I did not want him to give
the duke a description of the unknown gentleman who was staying at
Avranches. Yet, as I went, I had time to hear Marie&rsquo;s slow
musical voice say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming at all to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very glad of it, and pursued my round of the town with a
lighter heart. Presently, after half an hour&rsquo;s walk, I found
myself opposite the church, and thus nearly back at the hotel: and
in front of the church stood Marie Delhasse, looking at <em>the
fa&ccedil;ade</em>.</p>
<p>Raising my hat I went up to her, her friendliness of the evening
before encouraging me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are going to stay to-day?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Then she smiled, but not
mirthfully. &ldquo;I expect to be very much pressed to go this
afternoon,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I made a shot&mdash;apparently at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone will come and carry you off?&rdquo; I asked
jestingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely. My presence here will be
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But need you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked on the ground and made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps though,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;he&mdash;or
she&mdash;will not come. He may be too much occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To come for me?&rdquo; she said, with the first touch of
coquetry which I had seen in her lighting up her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even for that, it is possible,&rdquo; I rejoined.</p>
<p>We began to walk together toward the edge of the open
<em>place</em> in front of the church. The convent came in sight as
we reached the fall of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How peaceful that looks!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I wonder
if it would be pleasant there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was myself just wondering how the Duchess of Saint-Maclou
found it, when a loud cry of warning startled us. We had been
standing on the edge of the road, and a horse, going at a quick
trot, was within five yards of us. As it reached us, it was sharply
reined in. To my amazement, old Jean, the duchess&rsquo; servant,
sat upon it. When he saw me, a smile spread over his weather-beaten
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was nearly over you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You had no
ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I am sorry to say that Jean winked, insinuating that Marie
Delhasse and I had been preoccupied.</p>
<p>The diplomacy of non-recognition had failed to strike Jean. I
made the best of a bad job, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie stood a few paces off, regarding us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Mme. la Duchesse,&rdquo; grinned
Jean.</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse took a step forward when she heard his reference
to the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her absence was discovered by Suzanne at six
o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; the old fellow went on.
&ldquo;And the duke&mdash;ah, take care how you come near him, sir!
Oh, it&rsquo;s a kettle of fish! For as I came I met that coxcomb
Lafleur riding back with a message from the duke&rsquo;s guests
that they would not come to-day! So the duchess is gone, and the
ladies are not come; and the duke&mdash;he has nothing to do but
curse that whippersnapper of a Pierre who came last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Jean ended in a rapturous hoarse chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were riding so fast, then, because you were after the
duchess?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rode fast for fear,&rdquo; said Jean, with a shrewd
smile, &ldquo;that I should stop somewhere on the road. Well, I
have looked in Avranches. She is not in Avranches. I&rsquo;ll go
home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse came close to my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; she said to me, &ldquo;if he speaks of
the Duchess of Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put the question as I was directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have guessed better if you&rsquo;d
known,&rdquo; said Jean; and a swift glance from Marie Delhasse
told me that her suspicion as to my knowledge was aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will happen, Jean?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good God knows,&rdquo; shrugged Jean. Then,
remembering perhaps my five-franc pieces, he said politely,
&ldquo;I hope you are well, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up to now, thank you, Jean,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>His glance traveled to Marie. I saw his shriveled lips curl; his
expression was ominous of an unfortunate remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; said I significantly.</p>
<p>Jean had some wits. He spared me the remark, but not the sly
leer that had been made to accompany it. He clapped his heels to
his horse&rsquo;s side and trotted off in the direction from which
he had come. So that he could swear he had been to Avranches, he
was satisfied!</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse turned to me, asking haughtily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? What do you know of the Duke
or Duchess of Saint-Maclou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might return your question,&rdquo; said I, looking her
in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you answer it?&rdquo; she said, flushing red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mlle. Delhasse, I will not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this &lsquo;absence&rsquo; of the
Duchess of Saint-Maclou which that man talks about so
meaningly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said, speaking low and slow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the friends whom you are on your way to
visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What do you know
about it? What concern is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no indolence or lack of animation in her manner now.
She questioned me with imperious indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer not a single word,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;But&mdash;you asked me last night what I had heard of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, and shut her lips tightly on the
word.</p>
<p>I held my peace; and in a moment she went on passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would have guessed that you would insult me? Is it
your habit to insult women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine only, it seems,&rdquo; said I, meeting her
glance boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you, then, an invitation from Mme. de
Saint-Maclou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back as if I had struck her. And I felt as though I had
struck her. She looked at me for a moment with parted lips; then,
without a word or a sign, she turned and walked slowly away in the
direction of the hotel.</p>
<p>And I, glad to have something else to occupy my thoughts,
started at a brisk pace along the foot-path that runs down the hill
and meets the road which would lead me to the convent, for I had a
thing or two to say to the duchess. And yet it was not of the
duchess only that I thought as I went. There were also in my mind
the indignant pride with which Marie Delhasse had questioned me,
and the shrinking shame in her eyes at that counter-question of
mine. The Duke of Saint-Maclou&rsquo;s invitation seemed to bring
as much disquiet to one of his guests as it had to his wife
herself. But one thing struck me, and I found a sort of comfort in
it: she had thought, it seemed, that the duchess was to be at
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; I cried suddenly to myself. &ldquo;If she
weren&rsquo;t pretty, you&rsquo;d say that made it
worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I went on in a bad temper.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>wenty minutes&rsquo; walking brought
me to the wood which lay between the road and the convent. I
pressed on; soon the wood ceased and I found myself on the
outskirts of a paddock of rough grass, where a couple of cows and
half a dozen goats were pasturing; a row of stunted apple trees ran
along one side of the paddock, and opposite me rose the white walls
of the convent; while on my left was the burying-ground with its
arched gateway, inscribed &ldquo;<em>Mors janua
vit&aelig;</em>.&rdquo; I crossed the grass and rang a bell, that
clanged again and again in echo. Nobody came. I pulled a second
time and more violently. After some further delay the door was
cautiously opened a little way, and a young woman looked out. She
was a round-faced, red-cheeked, fresh creature, arrayed in a large
close-fitting white cap, a big white collar over her shoulders, and
a black gown. When she saw me, she uttered an exclamation of alarm,
and pushed the door to again. Just in time I inserted my foot
between door and doorpost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I politely, &ldquo;but you
evidently misunderstand me. I wish to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She peered at me through the two-inch gap my timely foot had
preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is impossible,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;Our
rules do not allow it. Indeed, I may not talk to you. I beg of you
to move your foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then you would shut the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not deny it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean no harm,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The guile of the wicked is infinite,&rsquo;&rdquo;
remarked the little nun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see the Mother Superior,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Will you take my name to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard another step in the passage. The door was flung wide
open, and a stout and stately old lady faced me, a frown on her
brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;until you hear my errand
you will think me an ill-mannered fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for your ear alone, madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in here,&rdquo; said she
decisively.</p>
<p>For a moment I was at a loss. Then the simplest solution in the
world occurred to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can come out, madame,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>She looked at me doubtfully for a minute. Then she stepped out,
shutting the door carefully behind her. I caught a glimpse of the
little nun&rsquo;s face, and thought there was a look of
disappointment on it. The old lady and I began to walk along the
path that led to the burying-ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whether you have
heard of me. My name is Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so. Mr. Aycon, I must tell you that you are
very much to blame. You have led this innocent, though thoughtless,
child into most deplorable conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Well done, little duchess!&rdquo; said I to myself; but
of course I was not going to betray her.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deeply regret my thoughtlessness,&rdquo; said I
earnestly. &ldquo;I would, however, observe that the present
position of the duchess is not due to my&mdash;shall we say
misconduct?&mdash;but to that of her husband. I did not
invite&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention her name!&rdquo; interrupted the
Mother Superior in horror.</p>
<p>We had reached the arched gateway; and there appeared standing
within it a figure most charmingly inappropriate to a
graveyard&mdash;the duchess herself, looking as fresh as a daisy,
and as happy as a child with a new toy. She ran to me, holding out
both hands and crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, dear Mr. Aycon, you are the most delightful
man alive! You come at the very moment I want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sober, my child, be sober!&rdquo; murmured the old
lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to hear,&rdquo; expostulated the duchess.
&ldquo;Do you know anything, Mr. Aycon? What has been happening up
at the house? What has the duke done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the duchess poured out her questions, we passed through the
gate; the ladies sat down on a stone bench just inside, and I,
standing, told my story. The duchess was amused to hear of old
Jean&rsquo;s chase of her; but she showed no astonishment till I
told her that Marie Delhasse was at the hotel in Avranches, and had
declined to go further on her journey to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the hotel? Then you&rsquo;ve seen her?&rdquo; she
burst out. &ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is most extremely handsome,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Moreover, I am inclined to like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mother Superior opened her lips&mdash;to reprove me, no
doubt; but the duchess was too quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you like her? Perhaps you&rsquo;re going to desert me
and go over to her?&rdquo; she cried in indignation, that was, I
think, for the most part feigned. Certainly the duchess did not
look very alarmed. But in regard to what she said, the old lady was
bound to have a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Mr. Aycon to you, my child?&rdquo; said she
solemnly. &ldquo;He is nothing&mdash;nothing at all to you, my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want him to be less than nothing to Mlle.
Delhasse,&rdquo; said the duchess, with a pout for her protector
and a glance for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mlle. Delhasse is very angry with me just now,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why?&rdquo; asked the duchess eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she gathered that I thought she ought to wait for
an invitation from you, before she went to your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should wait till the Day of Judgment!&rdquo; cried
the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not matter,&rdquo; observed the Mother
Superior dryly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without pretext or excuse, the duchess turned and
walked very quickly&mdash;nay, she almost ran&mdash;away along the
path that encircled the group of graves. Her eye had bidden me, and
I followed no less briskly. I heard a despairing sigh from the poor
old lady, but she had no chance of overtaking us. The audacious
movement was successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can talk,&rdquo; said the duchess.</p>
<p>And talk she did, for she threw at me the startling
assertion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re falling in love with Mlle.
Delhasse. If you do, I&rsquo;ll never speak to you
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall probably accept
that among the other disadvantages of the entanglement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very rude,&rdquo; observed the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing with an &lsquo;if&rsquo; in it is rude,&rdquo;
said I speciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men must be always in love with somebody,&rdquo; said she
resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly approaches a necessity,&rdquo; I
assented.</p>
<p>The duchess glanced at me. Perhaps I had glanced at her; I hope
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t we better
talk business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infinitely better,&rdquo; said I; and I meant it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; she asked, with a return to her
more friendly manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>It is generally the safest advice&mdash;to women at all
events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are content with the position? You like being at the
hotel perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I not be hard to please, if I
didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are trying to annoy me, but you shan&rsquo;t.
Mr. Aycon, suppose my husband comes over to Avranches, and sees
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you decided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to think about it till it happens. But won&rsquo;t he
be thinking more about you than me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do anything about me,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;In the first place, he will want no scandal. In the second,
he does not want me. But he will come over to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her&rdquo; was, of course, Marie Delhasse. The duchess
assigned to her the sinister distinction of the simple pronoun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely he will take means to get you to go back?&rdquo; I
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he could have caught me before I got here, he would
have been glad. Now he will wait; for if he came here and claimed
me, what he proposed to do would become known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed reason in this; the duchess calculated
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I had better go back to
the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not seem to vex you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t stay here, can I?&rdquo; said I,
looking round at the nunnery. &ldquo;It would be irregular, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might go to another hotel,&rdquo; suggested she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most important that I should watch what is going on
at my present hotel,&rdquo; said I gravely; for I did not wish to
move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the most&mdash;&rdquo; began the duchess.</p>
<p>But this bit of character-reading was lost. Slow but sure, the
Mother Superior was at our elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>I felt sure that she must manage the nuns admirably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; said I, as though there was nothing else to
be said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; said the duchess, as though she would have
liked to say something else.</p>
<p>And all in a moment I was through the gateway and crossing the
paddock. But the duchess ran to the gate, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you come again to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My expedition consumed nearly two hours; and one o&rsquo;clock
struck from the tower of the church as I slowly climbed the hill,
feeling (I must admit it) that the rest of the day would probably
be rather dull. Just as I reached the top, however, I came plump on
Mlle. Delhasse, who appeared to be taking a walk. She bowed to me
slightly and coldly. Glad that she was so distant (for I did not
like her looks), I returned her salute, and pursued my way to the
hotel. In the porch of it stood the waiter&mdash;my friend who had
taken such an obliging view of my movements the night before.
Directly he saw me, he came out into the road to meet me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you acquainted with the ladies who have rooms on the
first floor?&rdquo; he asked with an air of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met them here for the first time,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>I believe he doubted me; perhaps waiters are bred to suspicion
by the things they see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;then it does not interest you
to know that a gentleman has been to see the young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took out ten francs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does,&rdquo; said I, handing him the money.
&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Saint-Maclou,&rdquo; he whispered
mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; I asked in some alarm. I had no wish
to encounter him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This half-hour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see both the ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only the young lady. Madame went out immediately on
his arrival, and is not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking I had not got much, save good will, for my ten
francs&mdash;for he told me nothing but what I had expected to
hear&mdash;I was about to pass on, when he added, in a tone which
seemed more significant than the question demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going up to your room, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to show you the way,&rdquo; he
said&mdash;though his escort seemed to me very unnecessary.</p>
<p>He mounted before me. We reached the first floor. Opposite to
us, not three yards away, was the door of the sitting-room which I
knew to be occupied by the Delhasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then he held up his hand in the attitude of a man who
listens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One should not listen,&rdquo; he whispered,
apologetically; &ldquo;but it is so strange. I thought that if you
knew the lady&mdash;Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that we ought not to listen. But the mystery of the
fellow&rsquo;s manner and the concern of his air constrained me,
and I too paused, listening.</p>
<p>From behind the door there came to our strained attentive ears
the sound of a woman sobbing. I sought the waiter&rsquo;s eyes;
they were already bent on me. Again the sad sounds came&mdash;low,
swift, and convulsive. It went to my heart to hear them. I did not
know what to do. To go on upstairs to my own room and mind my own
business seemed the simple thing&mdash;simple, easy, and proper.
But my feet were glued to the boards. I could not go, with that
sound beating on my ears: I should hear it all the day. I glanced
again at the waiter. He was a kind-looking fellow, and I saw the
tears standing in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mademoiselle is so beautiful!&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil business is it of yours?&rdquo; said I, in
a low but fierce tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am content to leave it to
you, sir;&rdquo; and without more he turned and went
downstairs.</p>
<p>It was all very well to leave it to me; but what&mdash;failing
that simple, easy, proper, and impossible course of action which I
have indicated&mdash;was I to do?</p>
<p>Well, what I did was this: I went to the door of the room and
knocked softly. There was no answer. The sobs continued. I had been
a brute to this girl in the morning; I thought of that as I stood
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! what&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo; I
whispered.</p>
<p>And then I opened the door softly.</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse sat in a chair, her head resting in her hands and
her hands on the table; and her body was shaken with her
weeping.</p>
<p>And on the table, hard by her bowed golden head, there lay a
square leathern box. I stood on the threshold and looked at
her.</p>
<p>The rest of the day did not now seem likely to be dull; but it
might prove to have in store for me more difficult tasks than the
enduring of a little dullness.</p>

<p><span class="hide">F</span>or a moment I stood stock still,
wishing to Heaven that I had not opened the door; for I could find
now no excuse for my intrusion, and no reason why I should not have
minded my own business. The impulse that had made the thing done
was exhausted in the doing of it. Retreat became my sole object;
and, drawing back, I pulled the door after me. But I had given
Fortune a handle&mdash;very literally; for the handle of the door
grated loud as I turned it. Despairing of escape, I stood still.
Marie Delhasse looked up with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she cried in frightened tones,
hastily pressing her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
<p>There was no help for it. I stepped inside, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to say that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I deserved and expected an outburst of indignation. My surprise
was great when she sank against the back of the chair with a sigh
of relief. I lingered awkwardly just inside the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want? Why did you come in?&rdquo; she asked,
but rather in bewilderment than anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was passing on my way upstairs, and&mdash;and you
seemed to be in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I make such a noise as that?&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as bad as a child; but children cry because they
mustn&rsquo;t do things, and I because I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We appeared to be going to talk. I shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My intrusion is most impertinent,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;You have every right to resent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, have I the right to resent anything? Did you think so
this morning?&rdquo; she asked impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;is a terribly
righteous time with me. I must beg your pardon for what I
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the same still?&rdquo; she retorted
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no excuse for having said it,&rdquo; I returned.
&ldquo;It was not my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nobody&rsquo;s affair, I suppose, but
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you allow it to be,&rdquo; said I. I could not
endure the desolation her words and tone implied.</p>
<p>She looked at me curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said in a fretfully
weary tone, &ldquo;how you come to be mixed up in it at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; Then I went on abruptly:
&ldquo;You thought it was someone else that had entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone returning,&rdquo; said I stepping up to the table
opposite her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; she asked, but wearily and not in the
defiant manner of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mme. Delhasse perhaps, or perhaps the Duke of
Saint-Maclou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse made no answer. She sat with her elbows on the
table, and her chin resting on the support of her clenched hands;
her lids drooped over her eyes; and I could not see the expression
of her glance, which was, nevertheless, upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t
talk about him. Have you been doing some shopping?&rdquo; And I
pointed to the red leathern box.</p>
<p>For full half a minute she sat, without speech or movement. Then
she said in answer to my question, which she could not take as an
idle one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been doing some bargaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the result?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she paused long before she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is a trifle&mdash;thrown
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bind the bargain?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Aycon&mdash;to bind the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it allowed to look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think everything must be allowed to you. You would be
so surprised if it were not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood that she was aiming a satirical remark at me: I did
not mind that; she had better flay me alive than sit and cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I may open the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key is in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I drew the box across, and I took a chair that stood by. I
turned the key of the box. A glance showed me Marie&rsquo;s drooped
lids half raised and her eyes fixed on my face.</p>
<p>I opened the box: there lay in it, in sparkling coil on the blue
velvet, a magnificent diamond necklace; one great stone formed a
pendent, and it was on this stone that I fixed my regard. I took it
up and looked at it closely; then I examined the necklace itself.
Marie&rsquo;s eyes followed my every motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like these trinkets?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, in that tone in which
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; is stronger than a thousand words of rapture; and
the depths of her eyes caught fire from the stones, and
gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know nothing about them,&rdquo; I pursued
composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are valuable,&rdquo; said she, making an
effort after <em>nonchalance</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have some value,&rdquo; I conceded, smiling.
&ldquo;But I mean about their history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are bought, I suppose&mdash;bought and
sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know just a little about such things. In
fact, I have a book at home in which there is a picture of this
necklace. It is known as the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace. The stones
were collected by Cardinal Armand de Saint-Maclou, Archbishop of
Caen, some thirty years ago. They were set by Lebeau of Paris, on
the order of the cardinal, and were left by him to his nephew, our
friend the duke. Since his marriage, the duchess has of course worn
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this I said in a most matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they belong to her?&rdquo; asked Marie,
with a sudden lift of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Strictly, I should think not,&rdquo;
said I impassively.</p>
<p>Marie Delhasse stretched out her hand and began to finger the
stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wore them, did she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I supposed they had just been bought.&rdquo; And she
took her fingers off them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take a large sum to do that&mdash;to buy them
<em>en bloc</em>,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! The market varies so much:
perhaps a million francs, perhaps more. You can&rsquo;t tell how
much people will give for such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is difficult,&rdquo; she assented, again fingering
the necklace, &ldquo;to say what people will give for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I leaned back in my chair. There was a pause. Then her eyes
suddenly met mine again, and she exclaimed defiantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know very well what it means! What&rsquo;s the
good of fencing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know what it means,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;When
have you promised to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this thing?&rdquo; and I pointed to the
necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of&mdash;How dare you ask me such
questions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose from my seat and bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going?&rdquo; she asked, her fingers on the
necklace, and her eyes avoiding mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to enjoy the
friendship of the Duchess of Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that forbids you to enjoy mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed assent to her inference. She sat still at the table, her
chin on her hands. I was about to leave her, when it struck me all
in a moment that leaving her was not exactly the best thing to do,
although it might be much the easiest. I arrested my steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is not our acquaintance
ended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she suddenly opened her hands and hid her face in them. It
was a strange conclusion to a speech so coldly and distantly
begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo; said I,
bending a little across the table toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you? What&rsquo;s it to
anybody?&rdquo; came from between her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>She dropped her hands from her face, and laughed. It was a laugh
the like of which I hope not to hear again. Then she broke out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she have me in the house? Why did she
run away? Am I unfit to touch her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she were wrong, you&rsquo;re doing your best to make
her right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everybody thinks one wicked, one may as well be
wicked, and&mdash;and live in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get diamonds?&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t
you wicked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, looking me straight in the face.
&ldquo;But what difference did that make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all, in one point of view,&rdquo; said I. But to
myself I was swearing that she should not go.</p>
<p>Then she said in a very low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never leaves me. Ah! he makes everyone
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &lsquo;em think,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everyone thinks it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, nonsense!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what you thought. What honest woman would have
anything to do with me&mdash;or what honest man either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had nothing to say about that; so I said again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t go, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in lower tones, as she answered this appeal of
mine:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t refuse. He&rsquo;ll be here again; and my
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it off a day or two,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;And
don&rsquo;t take that thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, it seemed to me, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really care?&rdquo; she asked, speaking very
low.</p>
<p>I nodded. I did care, somehow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to stand by me, if I don&rsquo;t go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t refuse right out. My mother and
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have something the matter with you: flutters or
something,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>The ghost of a smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>I had to stay, anyhow. Perhaps I ought to have said so, and not
stolen credit; but all I did was to nod again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, if I ask you, you&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll stand
between me and him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hoped that my meeting with the duke would not be in a strong
light; but I only said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather! I&rsquo;ll do anything I can, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not thank me; she looked at me again. Then she
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother will be back soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had better not be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I advanced to the table again, and laid my hand on the box
containing the Cardinal&rsquo;s necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this?&rdquo; I asked in a careless tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to send them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of saying I do? I love them.
Besides, he&rsquo;ll see through it. He&rsquo;ll know that I mean I
won&rsquo;t come. I daren&rsquo;t&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t show him
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I made a little venture; for, fingering the box idly, I
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be uncommonly handsome of you to give &lsquo;em
to the duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the duchess?&rdquo; she gasped in wondering tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;either they are the
duchess&rsquo;, in which case she ought to have them; or, if they
were the duke&rsquo;s, they&rsquo;re yours now; and you can do what
you like with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave them me on&mdash;on a condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A condition,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no gentleman could
mention, and no law enforce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed scarlet, but sat silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge is sweet,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;She ran away
rather than meet you. You send her her diamonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden gleam shot into Marie Delhasse&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; And stopped,
thinking, with her hands clasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You send them by me,&rdquo; I pursued, delighted with the
impression which my suggestion had made upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By you? You see her, then?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Occasionally,&rdquo; I answered. The duchess&rsquo;
secret was not mine, and I did not say where I saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them to you,&rdquo; said
Marie&mdash;&ldquo;to you, not to the duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have &lsquo;em at any price,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Come, your mother will be back soon. I believe you want to
keep &lsquo;em.&rdquo; And I assumed a disgusted air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she flashed out passionately.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to touch them! I wouldn&rsquo;t keep them
for the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. With a swift motion, Marie Delhasse leaped
from her chair, dashed down the lid of the box, hiding the glitter
of the stones, seized the box in her two hands and with eyes
averted held it out to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the duchess?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the duchess,&rdquo; said Marie, with, averted
eyes.</p>
<p>I took the box, and stowed it in the capacious pocket of the
shooting-jacket which I was wearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Marie, pointing to the door.</p>
<p>I held out my hand. She caught it in hers. Upon my word, I
thought she was going to kiss it. So strongly did I think it that,
hating fuss of that sort, I made a half-motion to pull it away.
However, I was wrong. She merely pressed it and let it drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up! cheer up! I&rsquo;ll turn up again soon,&rdquo;
said I, and I left the room.</p>
<p>And left in the nick of time; for at the very moment when I,
hugging the lump in my coat which marked the position of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace, reached the foot of the stairs Mme.
Delhasse appeared on her way up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you old viper!&rdquo; I murmured thoughtlessly, in
English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, monsieur?&rdquo; said Mme. Delhasse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me: I spoke to myself&mdash;a foolish
habit,&rdquo; I rejoined, with a low bow and, I&rsquo;m afraid, a
rather malicious smile. The old lady glared at me, bobbed her head
the slightest bit in the world, and passed me by.</p>
<p>I went out into the sunshine, whistling merrily. My good friend
the waiter stood by the door. His eyes asked me a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is much better,&rdquo; I said reassuringly. And I
walked out, still whistling merrily.</p>
<p>In truth I was very pleased with myself. Every man likes to
think that he understands women. I was under the impression that I
had proved myself to possess a thorough and complete acquaintance
with that intricate subject. I was soon to find that my knowledge
had its limitations. In fact, I have been told more than once since
that my plan was a most outrageous one. Perhaps it was; but it had
the effect of wresting those dangerous stones from poor
Marie&rsquo;s regretful hands. A man need not mind having made a
fool of himself once or twice on his way through the world, so he
has done some good by the process. At the moment, however, I felt
no need for any such apology.</p>

<h4>An Unparalleled Insult.</h4>

<div class="dropcap"><img src="images/09dc.png" alt="I" id=

<p><span class="hide">I</span> was thoughtful as I walked across
the <em>place</em> in front of the church in the full glare of the
afternoon sun. It was past four o&rsquo;clock; the town was more
lively, as folk, their day&rsquo;s work finished, came out to take
their ease and filled the streets and the <em>caf&eacute;s</em>. I
felt that I also had done something like a day&rsquo;s work; but my
task was not complete till I had lodged my precious trust safely in
the keeping of the duchess.</p>
<p>There was, however, still time to spare, and I sat down at a
<em>caf&eacute;</em> and ordered some coffee. While it was being
brought my thoughts played round Marie Delhasse. I doubted whether
I disliked her for being tempted, or liked her for resisting at the
last; at any rate, I was glad to have helped her a little. If I
could now persuade her to leave Avranches, I should have done all
that could reasonably be expected of me; if the duke pursued, she
must fight the battle for herself. So I mused, sipping my coffee;
and then I fell to wondering what the duchess would say on seeing
me again so soon. Would she see me? She must, whether she liked it
or not; I could not keep the diamonds all night. Perhaps she would
like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are again!&rdquo; I said to myself sharply, and
I roused myself from my meditations.</p>
<p>As I looked up, I saw the man Lafleur opposite to me. He had his
back toward me, but I knew him, and he was just walking into a shop
that faced the <em>caf&eacute;</em> and displayed in its windows an
assortment of offensive weapons&mdash;guns, pistols, and various
sorts of knives. Lafleur went in. I sat sipping my coffee. He was
there nearly twenty minutes; then he came out and walked leisurely
away. I paid my score and strolled over to the shop. I wondered
what he had been buying. Dueling pistols for the duke, perhaps! I
entered and asked to be shown some penknives. The shopman served me
with alacrity. I chose a cheap knife, and then I permitted my gaze
to rest on a neat little pistol that lay on the counter. My simple
<em>ruse</em> was most effective. In a moment I was being
acquainted with all the merits of the instrument, and the eulogy
was backed by the information that a gentleman had bought two
pistols of the same make not ten minutes before I entered the
shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, sir. It is a wise thing often to
carry one of these little fellows. One never knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case of a quarrel with another gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are hardly such as we sell for dueling,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are rather pocket pistols&mdash;to carry if you are
out at night; and we sell many to gentlemen who have occasion in
the way of their business to carry large sums of money or valuables
about with them. They give a sense of security, sir, even if no
occasion arises for their use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this gentleman bought two? Who was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. He gave me no name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t know him by sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; perhaps he is a stranger. But indeed I&rsquo;m
almost that myself: I have but just set up business
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it brisk?&rdquo; I asked, examining the pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a brisk place, sir,&rdquo; the man answered
regretfully. &ldquo;Let me sell you one, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened to be, for the moment, in the way of my business to
carry valuables, but I hoped it would not be for long, so that I
did not buy a pistol; but I allowed myself to wonder what my friend
Lafleur wanted with two&mdash;and they were not dueling pistols! If
I had been going to keep the diamonds&mdash;but then I was not.
And, reminded by this reflection, I set out at once for the
convent.</p>
<p>Now the manner in which the Duchess of Saint-Maclou saw fit to
treat me&mdash;who was desirous only of serving her&mdash;on this
occasion went far to make me disgusted with the whole affair into
which I had been drawn. It might have been supposed that she would
show gratitude; I think that even a little admiration and a little
appreciation of my tact would not have been, under the
circumstances, out of place. It is not every day that a lady has
such a thing as the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace rescued from great
peril and freely restored, with no claim (beyond that for ordinary
civility) on the part of the rescuer.</p>
<p>And the cause did not lie in her happening to be out of temper,
for she greeted me at first with much graciousness, and sitting
down on the corn bin (she was permitted on this occasion to meet me
in the stable), she began to tell me that she had received a most
polite&mdash;and indeed almost affectionate&mdash;letter from the
duke, in which he expressed deep regret for her absence, but
besought her to stay where she was as long as the health of her
soul demanded. He would do himself the honor of waiting on her and
escorting her home, when she made up her mind to return to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means,&rdquo; observed the duchess, as she replaced
the letter in her pocket, &ldquo;that the Delhasses are going, and
that if I go (without notice anyhow) I shall find them
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read it in the same way; but I&rsquo;m not so sure that
the Delhasses are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so charitable,&rdquo; said she, still quite
sweetly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t bring yourself to think evil of
anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess chanced to look so remarkably calm and composed as
she sat on the corn bin that I could not deny myself the pleasure
of surprising her with the sudden apparition of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace. Without a word, I took the case out of
my pocket, opened it, and held it out toward her. For once the
duchess sat stock-still, her eyes round and large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been robbing and murdering my husband?&rdquo;
she gasped.</p>
<p>With a very complacent smile I began my story. Who does not know
what it is to begin a story with a triumphant confidence in its
favorable reception? Who does not know that first terrible glimmer
of doubt when the story seems not to be making the expected
impression? Who has not endured the dull dogged despair in which
the story, damned by the stony faces of the auditors, has yet to
drag on a hated weary life to a dishonored grave?</p>
<p>These stages came and passed as I related to Mme. de
Saint-Maclou how I came to be in a position to hand back to her the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace. Still, silent, pale, with her lips
curled in a scornful smile, she sat and listened. My tone lost its
triumphant ring, and I finished in cold, distant, embarrassed
accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to execute my
commission and hand the box and its contents over to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, thus speaking, I laid the necklace in its case on the corn
bin beside the duchess.</p>
<p>The duchess said nothing at all. She looked at me
once&mdash;just once; and I wished then and there that I had
listened to Gustave de Berensac&rsquo;s second thoughts and left
with him at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Then having delivered
this barbed shaft of the eyes, the duchess sat looking straight in
front of her, bereft of her quick-changing glances, robbed of her
supple grace&mdash;like frozen quicksilver. And the necklace
glittered away indifferently between us.</p>
<p>At last the duchess, her eyes still fixed on the whitewashed
wall opposite, said in a slow emphatic tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t touch it, if it were the crown of
France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I plucked up my courage to answer her. For Marie
Delhasse&rsquo;s sake I felt a sudden anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are pharisaical,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The poor girl
has acted honorably. Her touch has not defiled your
necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must defend what you persuaded,&rdquo; flashed
out the duchess. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the greatest insult I was ever
subjected to in my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was the second lady I had insulted on that summer day!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did but suggest it&mdash;it was her own
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your suggestion is her wish! How charming!&rdquo; said
the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unjust to her!&rdquo; I said, a little
warmly.</p>
<p>The duchess rose from the corn bin, made the very most of her
sixty-three inches, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new insult to mention her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed that by; it was too absurd to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take it now I&rsquo;ve brought it,&rdquo; I
urged in angry puzzle.</p>
<p>The duchess put out her hand, grasped the case delicately, shut
it&mdash;and flung it to the other side of the stable, hard by
where an old ass was placidly eating a bundle of hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last time I shall touch it!&rdquo; said
she, turning and looking me in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do with it?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you please,&rdquo; returned Mme. de
Saint-Maclou; and without another word, without another glance,
either at me or at the necklace, she walked out of the stable, and
left me alone with the necklace and the ass.</p>
<p>The ass had given one start as the necklace fell with a thud on
the floor; but he was old and wise, and soon fell again to his
meal. I sat drumming my heels against the corn bin. Evening was
falling fast, and everything was very still. No man ever had a more
favorable hour for reflection and introspection. I employed it to
the full. Then I rose, and crossing the stable, pulled the long
ears of my friend who was eating the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you also were a young ass once,&rdquo; said I
with a rueful smile.</p>
<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t leave the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace in
the corner of the convent stable. I picked up the box. Neddy thrust
out his nose at it. I opened it and let him see the contents. He
snuffed scornfully and turned back to the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t take it either,&rdquo; said I to myself,
and with a muttered curse I dropped the wretched thing back in the
pocket of my coat, wishing much evil to everyone who had any hand
in bringing me into connection with it, from his Eminence the
Cardinal Armand de Saint-Maclou down to the waiter at the
hotel.</p>
<p>Slowly and in great gloom of mind I climbed the hill again. I
supposed that I must take the troublesome ornament back to Marie
Delhasse, confessing that my fine idea had ended in nothing save a
direct and stinging insult for her and a scathing snub for me. My
pride made this necessity hard to swallow, but I believe there was
also a more worthy feeling that caused me to shrink from it. I
feared that her good resolutions would not survive such treatment,
and that the rebuff would drive her headlong into the ruin from
which I had trusted that she would be saved. Yet there was nothing
else for it. Back the necklace must go. I could but pray&mdash;and
earnestly I did pray&mdash;that my fears might not be realized.</p>
<p>I found myself opposite the gun-maker&rsquo;s shop; and it
struck me that I might probably fail to see Marie alone that
evening. I had no means of defense&mdash;I had never thought any
necessary. But now a sudden nervousness got hold of me: it seemed
to me as if my manner must betray to everyone that I carried the
necklace&mdash;as if the lump in my coat stood out conspicuous as
Mont St. Michel itself. Feeling that I was doing a half-absurd
thing, still I stepped into the shop and announced that, on further
reflection, I would buy the little pistol. The good man was
delighted to sell it to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you carry valuables, sir,&rdquo; he said, repeating
his stock recommendation, &ldquo;it will give you a feeling of
perfect safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t carry valuables,&rdquo; said I abruptly,
almost rudely, and with most unnecessary emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did but suggest, sir,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;And
at least, it may be that you will require to do so some
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; I was forced to admit, &ldquo;is of course
not impossible.&rdquo; And I slid the pistol and a supply of
cartridges into the other pocket of my coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distribute the load, sir,&rdquo; advised the smiling
nuisance. &ldquo;One side of your coat will be weighed down. Ah,
pardon! I perceive that there is already something in the other
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sandwich-case,&rdquo; said I; and he bowed with exactly
the smile the waiter had worn when I said that I came from Mont St.
Michel.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>here is nothing else for it!&rdquo; I
exclaimed, as I set out for the hotel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not resist the conclusion that my presence in Avranches
was no longer demanded. The duchess had, on the one hand, arrived
at a sort of understanding with her husband; while she had, on the
other, contrived to create a very considerable misunderstanding
with me. She had shown no gratitude for my efforts, and made no
allowance for the mistakes which, possibly, I had committed. She
had behaved so unreasonably as to release me from any obligation.
As to Marie Delhasse, I had had enough (so I declared in the hasty
disgust my temper engendered) of Quixotic endeavors to rescue
people who, had they any moral resolution, could well rescue
themselves. There was only one thing left which I might with
dignity undertake&mdash;and that was to put as many miles as I
could between the scene of my unappreciated labors and myself. This
I determined to do the very next day, after handing back this
abominable necklace with as little obvious appearance of absurdity
as the action would permit.</p>
<p>It was six o&rsquo;clock when I reached the hotel and walked
straight up to my room in sulky isolation, looking neither to right
nor left, and exchanging a word with nobody. I tossed the red box
down on the table, and flung myself into an armchair. I had half a
mind to send the box down to Marie Delhasse by the
waiter&mdash;with my compliments; but my ill-humor did not carry me
so far as thus to risk betraying her to her mother, and I perceived
that I must have one more interview with her&mdash;and the sooner
the better. I rang the bell, meaning to see if I could elicit from
the waiter any information as to the state of affairs on the first
floor and the prospect of finding Marie alone for ten minutes.</p>
<p>I rang once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice; the third was a mighty
pull, and had at last the effect of bringing up my friend the
waiter, breathless, hot, and disheveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep me waiting like this?&rdquo; I asked
sternly.</p>
<p>His puffs and pants prevented him from answering for a full
half-minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was busy on the first floor, sir,&rdquo; he protested
at last. &ldquo;I came at the very earliest moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on on the first floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady is in a great hurry, sir. She is going away,
sir. She has been taking a hasty meal, and her carriage is ordered
to be round at the door this very minute. And all the luggage had
to be carried down, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I walked to the window, and, putting my head out, saw a closed
carriage, with four trunks and some smaller packages on the roof,
standing at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo; I asked, turning round.</p>
<p>The waiter was gone! A bell ringing violently from below
explained his disappearance, but did not soothe my annoyance. I
rang my bell very forcibly again: the action was a welcome vent for
my temper. Turning back to the window, I found the carriage still
there. A second or two later, Mme. Delhasse, attended by the waiter
who ought to have been looking after me, came out of the hotel and
got into the carriage. She spoke to the waiter, and appeared to
give him money. He bowed and closed the door. The driver started
his horses and made off at a rapid pace toward the carriage-road
down the hill. I watched till the vehicle was out of sight and then
drew my head in, giving a low puzzled whistle and forgetting the
better part of my irritation in the interest of this new
development. Where was the old witch going&mdash;and why was she
going alone?</p>
<p>Again I rang my bell; but the waiter was at the door before it
ceased tinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she going to?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the house of the Duke of Saint-Maclou, sir,&rdquo; he
answered, wiping his brow and sighing for relief that he had got
rid of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the young lady&mdash;where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has already gone, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already gone!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Gone where? Gone
when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two hours ago, sir&mdash;very soon after I saw you
go out, sir&mdash;a messenger brought a letter for the young lady.
I took it upstairs; she was alone when I entered. When she looked
at the address, sir, she made a little exclamation, and tore the
note open in a manner that showed great agitation. She read it; and
when she had read it stood still, holding it in her hand for a
minute or two. She had turned pale and breathed quickly. Then she
signed to me with her hand to go. But she stopped me with another
gesture, and&mdash;and then, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, get on!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, she asked if you were in the hotel, and I said
no&mdash;you had gone out, I did not know where. Upon that, she
walked to the window, and stood looking out for a time. Then she
turned round to me, and said: &lsquo;My mother was fatigued by her
walk, and is sleeping. I am going out, but I do not wish her
disturbed. I will write a note of explanation. Be so good as to
cause it to be given to her when she wakes.&rsquo; She was calm
then, sir; she sat down and wrote, and sealed the note and gave it
to me. Then she caught up her hat, which lay on the table, and her
gloves; and then, sir, she walked out of the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went, sir, as if she were making for the footpath
down the hill. An hour or more passed, and then madame&rsquo;s bell
rang. I ran up and, finding her in the sitting room, I gave her the
note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She read it, and cried &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; in great
satisfaction, and immediately ordered a carriage and that the maid
should pack all her luggage and the young lady&rsquo;s. Oh! she was
in a great hurry, and in the best of spirits; and she pressed us on
so that I was not able to attend properly to you, sir. And finally,
as you saw, she drove off to the house of the duke, still in high
good humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter paused. I sat silent in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you wish to know, sir?&rdquo;
asked the waiter.</p>
<p>Then my much-tried temper gave way again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what the devil it all means!&rdquo; I
roared.</p>
<p>The waiter drew near, wearing a very sympathetic expression. I
knew that he had always put me down as an admirer of Marie
Delhasse. He saw in me now a beaten rival. Curiously I had
something of the feeling myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing, sir,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The
stable-boy told me. The message for Mlle. Delhasse was brought from
a carriage which waited at the bottom of the hill, out of sight of
the town. And&mdash;well, sir, the servants wore no livery; but the
boy declares that the horses were those of the Duke of
Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I muttered angrily to myself. The waiter, discreetly ignoring my
words, continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, indeed, sir, madame expected to meet her daughter.
For I chanced to ask her if she would take with her a bouquet of
roses which she had purchased in the town, and she answered:
&lsquo;Give them to me. My daughter will like to have
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter&rsquo;s conclusion was obvious. And yet I did not
accept it. For why, if Marie were going to the duke&rsquo;s, should
she not have aroused her mother and gone with her? That the duke
had sent his carriage for her was likely enough; that he would
cause it to wait outside the town was not impossible; that Marie
had told her mother that she had gone to the duke&rsquo;s was also
clear from that lady&rsquo;s triumphant demeanor. But that she had
in reality gone, I could not believe. A sudden thought struck
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mlle. Delhasse,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;send any
answer to the note that came from the carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, I forgot. Certainly. She wrote an answer, and
the messenger carried it away with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did the boy you speak of see anything more of the
carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not pass that way again, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mind was now on the track of Marie&rsquo;s device. The duke
had sent his carriage to fetch her. She, left alone, unable to turn
to me for guidance, determined not to go; afraid to defy
him&mdash;more afraid, no doubt, because she could no longer
produce the necklace&mdash;had played a neat trick. She must have
sent a message to the duke that she would come with her mother
immediately that the necessary preparations could be made; she had
then written a note to her mother to tell her that she had gone in
the duke&rsquo;s carriage and looked to her mother to follow her.
And having thus thrown both parties on a false scent, she had put
on her hat and walked quietly out of the hotel. But, then, where
had she walked to? My chain of inference was broken by that missing
link. I looked up at the waiter. And then I cursed my carelessness.
For the waiter&rsquo;s eyes were no longer fixed on my face, but
were fastened in eloquent curiosity on the red box which lay on my
table. To my apprehensive fancy the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace
seemed to glitter through the case. That did not of course happen;
but a jewel case is easy to recognize, and I knew in a moment that
the waiter discerned the presence of precious stones. Our eyes met.
In my puzzle I could do nothing but smile feebly and
apologetically. The waiter smiled also&mdash;but his was a smile of
compassion and condolence. He took a step nearer to me, and with
infinite sympathy in his tone observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, sir, do not despair! A gentleman like you will
soon find another lady to value the present more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of my vanity&mdash;and I was certainly not presenting
myself in a very triumphant guise to the waiter&rsquo;s
imagination&mdash;I jumped at the mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are capricious creatures!&rdquo; said I with a
shrug. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trouble myself no more about
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, sir, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s
one one day, and another another. It&rsquo;s a pity, sir, to waste
thought on them&mdash;much more, good money. You will dine
to-night, sir?&rdquo; and his tone took a consolatory
inflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I will dine,&rdquo; said I; and with a last nod
of intelligence and commiseration, he withdrew.</p>
<p>And then I leaped, like a wildcat, on the box that contained the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace, intent on stowing it away again in the
seclusion of my coat-pocket. But again I stood with it in my
hand&mdash;struck still with the thought that I could not now
return it to Marie Delhasse, that she had vanished leaving it on my
hands, and that, in all likelihood, in three or four hours&rsquo;
time the Duke of Saint-Maclou would be scouring the country and
setting every spring in motion in the effort to find the truant
lady, and&mdash;what I thought he would be at least anxious
about&mdash;the truant necklace. For to give your family heirlooms
away without recompense is a vexatious thing; and ladies who accept
them and vanish with them into space can claim but small
consideration. And, moreover, if the missing property chance to be
found in the possession of a gentleman who is reluctant to explain
his presence, who has masqueraded as a groom with intent to deceive
the owner of the said property, and has no visible business to
bring or keep him on the spot at all&mdash;when all this happens,
it is apt to look very awkward for that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will regret it if you don&rsquo;t start with
me;&rdquo; so said Gustave de Berensac. The present was one of the
moments in which I heartily agreed with his prescient prophecy.
Human nature is a poor thing. To speak candidly, I cannot recollect
that, amid my own selfish perplexities, I spared more than one
brief moment to gladness that Marie Delhasse had eluded the pursuit
of the Duke of Saint-Maclou. But I spared another to wishing that
she had thought of telling me to what haven she was bound.</p>

<h4>A Very Clever Scheme.</h4>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<div class="dropcap"><img src="images/11dc.png" alt="I" id=
"img11dc" name="img11dc" width="100%" /></div>
<p><span class="hide">I</span> must confess at once that I might
easily have displayed more acumen, and that there would have been
nothing wonderful in my discerning or guessing the truth about
Marie Delhasse&rsquo;s movements. Yet the truth never occurred to
me, never so much as suggested itself in the shape of a possible
explanation. I cannot quite tell why; perhaps it conflicted too
strongly with the idea of her which possessed me; perhaps it was
characteristic of a temperament so different from my own that I
could not anticipate it. At any rate, be the reason what it may, I
did not seriously doubt that Marie Delhasse had cut the cords which
bound her by a hasty flight from Avranches; and my conviction was
deepened by my knowledge that an evening train left for Paris just
about half an hour after Marie, having played her trick on her
mother and on the Duke of Saint-Maclou, had walked out of the
hotel, no man and no woman hindering her.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, my work&mdash;imposed and voluntary
alike&mdash;was done; and the cheering influence of the dinner to
which I sat down so awoke my mind to fresh agility that I found the
task of disembarrassing myself of that old man of the sea&mdash;the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace&mdash;no longer so hopeless as it had
appeared in the hungry disconsolate hour before my meal. Nay, I saw
my way to performing, incidentally, a final service to Marie by
creating in the mind of the duke such chagrin and anger as would, I
hoped, disincline him from any pursuit of her. If I could, by one
stroke, restore him his diamonds and convince him, not of
Marie&rsquo;s virtue, but of her faithlessness, I trusted to be
humbly instrumental in freeing her from his importunity, and of
restoring the jewels to the duchess&mdash;nay, of restoring to her
also the undisturbed possession of her home and of the society of
her husband. At this latter prospect I told myself that I ought to
feel very satisfied, and rather to my surprise found myself feeling
not very dissatisfied; for most unquestionably the duchess had
treated me villainously and had entirely failed to appreciate me.
My face still went hot to think of the glance she had given Marie
Delhasse&rsquo;s maladroit ambassador.</p>
<p>After these reflections and a bottle of Burgundy (I will not
apportion the credit) I rose from the table humming a tune and
started to go upstairs, conning my scheme in a contented mind. As I
passed through the hall the porter handed me a note, saying that a
boy had left it and that there was no answer. I opened and read it;
it was very short and it ran thus:</p>
<p>I wish never to see you again. ELSA.</p>
<p>Now &ldquo;Elsa&rdquo; (and I believe that I have not mentioned
the fact before&mdash;an evidence, if any were needed, of my
discretion) was the Christian name of the Duchess of Saint-Maclou.
Picking up her dropped handkerchief as we rambled through the
woods, I had seen the word delicately embroidered thereon, and I
had not forgotten this chance information. But why&mdash;let those
learned in the ways of women answer if they can&mdash;why, first,
did she write at all? Why, secondly, did she tell me what had been
entirely obvious from her demeanor? Why, thirdly, did she choose to
affix to the document which put an end to our friendship a name
which that friendship had never progressed far enough to justify me
in employing? To none of these pertinent queries could I give a
satisfactory reply. Yet, somehow, that &ldquo;Elsa&rdquo; standing
alone, shorn of all aristocratic trappings, had a strange
attraction for me, and carried with it a pleasure that the
uncomplimentary tenor of the rest of the document did not entirely
obliterate. &ldquo;Elsa&rdquo; wished never to see me again: that
was bad; but it was &ldquo;Elsa&rdquo; who was so wicked as to wish
that: that was good. And by a curious freak of the mind it occurred
to me as a hardship that I had not received so much as a note of
one line from&mdash;&ldquo;Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said I aloud and peevishly; and I thrust
the letter into my pocket, cheek by jowl with the Cardinal&rsquo;s
Necklace. And being thus vividly reminded of the presence of that
undesired treasure, I became clearly resolved that I must not be
arrested for theft merely because the Duchess of Saint-Maclou chose
(from hurry, or carelessness, or what motive you will) to sign a
disagreeable and unnecessary communication with her Christian name
and nothing more, nor because Mlle. Delhasse chose to vanish
without a word of civil farewell. Let them go their ways&mdash;I
did not know which of them annoyed me more. Notwithstanding the
letter, notwithstanding the disappearance, my scheme must be
carried out. And then&mdash;for home! But the conclusion came glum
and displeasing.</p>
<p>The scheme was very simple. I intended to spend the hours of the
night in an excursion to the duke&rsquo;s house. I knew that old
Jean slept in a detached cottage about half a mile from the
<em>ch&acirc;teau</em>. Here I should find the old man. I would
hand to him the necklace in its box, without telling him what the
contents of the box were. Jean would carry the parcel to his
master, and deliver with it a message to the effect that a
gentleman who had left Avranches that afternoon had sent the parcel
by a messenger to the duke, inasmuch as he had reason to believe
that the article contained therein was the property of the duke and
that the duke would probably be glad to have it restored to him.
The significant reticence of this message was meant to inform the
duke that Marie Delhasse was not so solitary in her flight but that
she could find a cavalier to do her errands for her, and one who
would not acquiesce in the retention of the diamonds. I imagined,
with a great deal of pleasure, what the duke&rsquo;s feelings would
be in face of the communication. Thus, then, the diamonds were to
be restored, the duke disgusted, and I myself freed from all my
troubles. I have often thought since that the scheme was really
very ingenious, and showed a talent for intrigue which has been
notably wanting in the rest of my humble career.</p>
<p>The scheme once prosperously carried through, I should, of
course, take my departure at the earliest moment on the following
day. I might, or I might not, write a line of dignified
remonstrance to the duchess, but I should make no attempt to see
her; and I should most certainly go. Moreover, it would be a long
while before I accepted any of her harum-scarum invitations
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa&rdquo; indeed! Somehow I could not say it with quite
the indignant scorn which I desired should be manifest in my tone.
I have never been able to be indignant with the duchess; although I
have laughed at her. Now I could be, and was, indignant with Marie
Delhasse; though, in truth, her difficult position pleaded excuses
for her treatment of me which the duchess could not advance.</p>
<p>As the clock of the church struck ten I walked downstairs from
my room, wearing a light short overcoat tightly buttoned up. I
informed the waiter that I was likely to be late, secured the loan
of a latchkey, and left my good friend under the evident impression
that I was about to range the shores of the bay in love-lorn
solitude. Then I took the footpath down the hill and, swinging
along at a round pace, was fairly started on my journey. If the
inference I drew from the next thing I saw were correct, it was
just as well for me to be out of the way for a little while. For,
when I was still about thirty yards from the main road, there
dashed past the end of the lane leading up the hill a carriage and
pair, traveling at full speed. I could not see who rode inside; but
two men sat on the box, and there was luggage on the top. I could
not be sure in the dim light, but I had a very strong impression
that the carriage was the same as that which had conveyed Mme.
Delhasse out of my sight earlier in the evening. If it were so, and
if the presence of the luggage indicated that of its owner, the
good lady, arriving alone, must have met with the scantest welcome
from the duke. And she would return in a fury of anger and
suspicion. I was glad not to meet her; for if she were searching
for explanation, I fancied, from glances she had given me, that I
was likely to come in for a share of her attention. In fact, she
might reasonably have supposed that I was interested in her
daughter; nor, indeed, would she have been wrong so far.</p>
<p>Briskly I pursued my way, and in something over an hour I
reached the turn in the road and, setting my face inland, began to
climb the hill. A mile further on I came on a bypath, and not
doubting from my memory of the direction, that this must be a short
cut to the house, I left the road and struck along the narrow
wooded track. But, although shorter than the road, it was not very
direct, and I found myself thinking it very creditable to the
topographical instinct of my friend and successor, Pierre, that he
should have discovered on a first visit, and without having been to
the house, that this was the best route to follow. With the
knowledge of where the house lay, however, it was not difficult to
keep right, and another forty minutes brought me, now creeping
along very cautiously, alertly, and with open ears, to the door of
old Jean&rsquo;s little cottage. No doubt he was fast asleep in his
bed, and I feared the need of a good deal of noisy knocking before
he could be awakened from a peasant&rsquo;s heavy slumber.</p>
<p>My delight was therefore great when I discovered
that&mdash;either because he trusted his fellow-men, or because he
possessed nothing in the least worth stealing&mdash;he had left his
door simply on the latch. I lifted the latch and walked in. A dim
lantern burned on a little table near the smoldering log-fire. Yet
the light was enough to tell me that my involuntary host was not in
the room. I passed across its short breadth to a door in the
opposite wall. The door yielded to a push; all was dark inside. I
listened for a sleeper&rsquo;s breathing, but heard nothing. I
returned, took up the lantern, and carried it with me into the
inner room. I held it above my head, and it enabled me to see the
low pallet-bed in the corner. But Jean was not lying in the
bed&mdash;nay, it was clear that he had not lain on the bed all
that night. Yet his bedtime was half-past eight or nine, and it was
now hard on one o&rsquo;clock. Jean was &ldquo;making a night of
it,&rdquo; that seemed very clear. But what was the business or
pleasure that engaged him? I admit that I was extremely annoyed. My
darling scheme, on which I had prided myself so much, was tripped
up by the trifling accident of Jean&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>What in the world, I asked again, kept the old man from his bed?
It suddenly struck me that he might, by the duke&rsquo;s orders,
have accompanied Mme. Delhasse back to Avranches, in order to be
able to report to his master any news that came to light there. He
might well have been the second man on the box. This reflection
removed my surprise at his absence, but not my vexation. I did not
know what to do! Should I wait? But he might not be back till
morning. Wearily, in high disgust, I recognized that the great
scheme had, for tonight at least, gone awry, and that I must tramp
back to Avranches, carrying my old man of the sea, the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace. For Jean could not read, and it was
useless to leave the parcel with written directions.</p>
<p>I went into the outer room, and set the lantern in its place; I
took a pull at my flask, and smoked a pipe. Then, with a last sigh
of vexation, I grasped my stick in my hand, rose to my feet, and
moved toward the door.</p>
<p>Ah! Hark! There was a footstep outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven, here comes the old fool!&rdquo; I
murmured.</p>
<p>The step came on, and, as it came, I listened to it; and as I
listened to it, the sudden satisfaction that had filled me as
suddenly died away; for, if that were the step of old Jean, may I
see no difference between the footfalls of an elephant and of a
ballet-dancer! And then, before I had time to form any plan, or to
do anything save stand staring in the middle of the floor, the
latch was lifted again, the door opened, and in walked&mdash;the
Duke of Saint-Maclou!</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he dim light served no further than
to show that a man was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jean, what news?&rdquo; asked the duke, drawing the
door close behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not Jean,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who the devil are you, and what are you doing
here?&rdquo; He advanced and held up the lantern. &ldquo;Why, what
are you hanging about for?&rdquo; he exclaimed the next moment,
with a start of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am not George Sampson either,&rdquo; said I
composedly. I had no mind to play any more tricks. As I must meet
him, it should be in my own character.</p>
<p>The duke studied me from top to toe. He twirled his mustache,
and a slight smile appeared on his full lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I know you as George Sampson, I think, sir,&rdquo;
said he, but in an altered tone. He spoke now as though to an
equal&mdash;to an enemy perhaps, but to an equal.</p>
<p>I was in some perplexity; but a moment later he relieved me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need trouble yourself with no denials,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Lafleur&rsquo;s story of the gentleman at Avranches,
with the description of him, struck me as strange; and for the
rest&mdash;there were two things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated himself on a stool. I leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I know my
wife pretty well; in the second, a secret known to four
maidservants&mdash; Really, sir, you were very
confiding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was doing no wrong,&rdquo; said I; though not, I
confess, in a very convinced tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the masquerade?&rdquo; he answered quickly,
hitting my weak point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you were known to be unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile broadened a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old crime of husbands, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Well, sir, I&rsquo;m no lawyer, and
it&rsquo;s not my purpose to question you on that matter. I will
put you to no denials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed. The civility of his demeanor was a surprise to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that were the only affair, I need not keep you ten
minutes,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;At least, I presume that my
friend would find you when he wanted to deliver a message from
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But may I ask why, if that is your intention,
you have delayed so long? You guessed I was at Avranches. Why not
have sent to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke tugged his mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know your name, sir,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the name,&rdquo; and he bowed slightly.
&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t send to you at Avranches because I was
otherwise occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, sir, that you take it so lightly,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the way, Mr. Aycon, before you question me,
isn&rsquo;t there a question I might ask you? How came you here
to-night?&rdquo; And, as he spoke, his smile vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say, beyond that I hoped to see your
servant Jean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what purpose? Come, sir, for what purpose? I have a
right to ask for what purpose.&rdquo; And his tone rose in
anger.</p>
<p>I was going to give him a straightforward answer. My hand was
actually on the way to the spot where I felt the red box pressing
against my side, when he rose from his seat and strode toward me;
and a sudden passion surged in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me! answer me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;m not asking about my wife; I don&rsquo;t care a farthing
for that empty little parrot. Answer me, sir, as you value your
life! What do you know of Marie Delhasse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he stood before me with uplifted hand, as though he meant to
strike me. I did not move, and we looked keenly into one
another&rsquo;s eyes. He controlled himself by a great effort, but
his hands trembled, as he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old hag who came to-night and dared to show her
filthy face here without her daughter&mdash;she told me of your
talks and walks. The girl was ready to come. Who stopped her? Who
turned her mind? Who was there but
you&mdash;you&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again his passion overcame him, and he was within an ace of
dashing his fist in my face.</p>
<p>My hands hung at my side, and I leaned easily against the
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I believe I stopped her!
I believe I turned her mind. I did my best, and except me, nobody
was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit the crime you charged me with. Nothing
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with her? Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, in angry incredulity. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I knew, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;It is
knowledge a man keeps to himself, isn&rsquo;t it? But, by Heaven,
you shall tell me before you leave this place, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already one good ground of quarrel,&rdquo; I
interrupted. &ldquo;What need is there of another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good ground of quarrel?&rdquo; he repeated, in a
questioning tone.</p>
<p>Honestly I believe that he had for the moment forgotten. His
passion for Marie Delhasse and fury at the loss of her filled his
whole mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;About the duchess?
True, Mr. Aycon. That will serve&mdash;as well as the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is not a real ground, I know none,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you told me that you kept her from
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For no purposes of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew back a step, smiling scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man is bound to protest that the lady is
virtuous,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but need he insist so much on his
own virtue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it so happens,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not a question of virtue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suppose there was something in my tone that caught his
attention, for his scornful air was superseded by an intent puzzled
gaze, and his next question was put in lower tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you stay in Avranches for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your wife asked me,&rdquo; said I. The answer was
true enough, but, as I wished to deal candidly with him, I added:
&ldquo;And, later on, Mlle. Delhasse expressed a similar
desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife and Mlle. Delhasse! Truly you are a
favorite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest men happen to be scarce in this
neighborhood,&rdquo; said I. I was becoming rather angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are one, I hope to be able to make them scarcer by
one more,&rdquo; said the duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we needn&rsquo;t wrangle over it any more,&rdquo;
said I; and I sat down on the lid of a chest that stood by the
hearth. But the duke sprang forward and seized me by the arm,
crying again in ungovernable rage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is safe from you, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll keep her safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I say, I know nothing about her, except that
she&rsquo;d be an honest girl if you&rsquo;d let her
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still holding my arm, and I let him hold it: the man was
hardly himself under the slavery of his passion. But again, at my
words, the wonder which I had seen before stole into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know where she is,&rdquo; he said, with a
straining look at my face, &ldquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off, leaving his sentence unfinished. Then he broke out
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe from me? I would make life a heaven for
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the old plea,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a thing a lie because it&rsquo;s old? There&rsquo;s
nothing in the world I would not give her&mdash;nothing I have not
offered her.&rdquo; Then he looked at me, repeating again:
&ldquo;You must know where she is.&rdquo; And then he whispered:
&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to be with her,&rdquo; said I. Any other
reason would not have appealed to him.</p>
<p>He sank down on the stool again and sat in a heap, breathing
heavily and quickly. He was wonderfully transfigured, and I hardly
knew in him the cold harsh man who had been my temporary master and
was the mocking husband of the duchess. Say all that may be said
about his passion, I could not doubt that it was life and death to
him. Justification he had none; excuse I found in my heart for him,
for it struck me&mdash;coming over me in a strange sudden
revelation as I sat and looked at him&mdash;that he had given such
love to the duchess, the gay little lady would have been
marvelously embarrassed. It was hers to dwell in a radiant
mid-ether, neither to mount to heaver nor descend to hell. And in
one of theses two must dwell such feelings as the
dukes&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He roused himself, and leaning forward spoke to me again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lived in the same house with her and talked
to her. You swear you don&rsquo;t love her? What? Has Elsa&rsquo;s
little figure come between?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was full of scorn. He seemed angry with me, not for
presuming to love his wife (nay, he would not believe that), but
for being so blind as not to love Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t love her!&rdquo; I answered, with a frown
on my face and slow words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never felt attracted to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not answer that question. I sat frowning in silence till
the duke spoke again, in a low hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she? What says she to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked up with a start, and met his searching wrathful gaze. I
shook my head; his question was new to me&mdash;new and
disturbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; and on that we sat in
silence for many moments.</p>
<p>Then he rose abruptly and stood beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; he said, in the smoother tones in which
he had begun our curious interview, &ldquo;I came near a little
while ago to doing a ruffianly thing, of a sort I am not wont to
do. We must fight out our quarrel in the proper way. Have you any
friends in the neighborhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite unknown,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>He thought for an instant, and then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a regiment quartered at Pontorson, and I have
acquaintances among the officers. If agreeable to you, we will
drive over there; we shall find gentlemen ready to assist
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are determined to fight?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, with a snap of his lips. &ldquo;Have
we not matters enough and to spare to fight about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t of course deny that you have a
pretext.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, Mr. Aycon, know that I have also a cause. Will
this morning suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard on two now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. We have time for a little rest; then I will
order the carriage and we will drive together to
Pontorson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that I should stay in your house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will so far honor me. I wish to settle this affair
at once, so as to be moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can but accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you could hardly get back to Avranches, if, as I
presume, you came on foot. Ah! you&rsquo;ve never told me why you
wished to see Jean;&rdquo; and he turned a questioning look on me
again, as he walked toward the door of the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay; you shall tell me in the house. Shall I lead the
way? Ah, but you know it!&rdquo; and he smiled grimly.</p>
<p>With a bow, I preceded him along the little path where I had
once waited for the duchess, and where Pierre, the new servant, had
found me. No words passed between us as we went. The duke advanced
to the door and unlocked it. We went in, nobody was about, and we
crossed the dimly lighted hall into the small room where supper had
been laid for three (three who should have been four) on the night
of my arrival. Meat, bread, and wine stood on the table now, and
with a polite gesture the duke invited me to a repast. I was tired
and hungry, and I took a hunch of bread and poured out some
wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What keeps Jean, I wonder?&rdquo; mused the duke, as he
sat down. &ldquo;Perhaps he has found her!&rdquo; and a gleam of
eager hope flashed from his eyes.</p>
<p>I made no comment&mdash;where was the profit in more sparring of
words? I munched my bread and drank my wine, thinking, by a
whimsical turn of thought, of Gustave de Berensac and his horror at
the table laid for three. Soon I laid down my napkin, and the duke
held out his cigarette case toward me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Aycon, if I&rsquo;m not keeping you
up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not feel sleepy,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same for both of us,&rdquo; he reminded me,
shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;Well, then, if you are
willing&mdash;of course you can refuse if you choose&mdash;I should
like to hear what brought you to Jean&rsquo;s quarters on foot from
Avranches in the middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear. I did not desire to meet you, if I could
avoid it, and therefore I sought old Jean, with the intention of
making him a messenger to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To restore to you something which has been left on my
hands and to which you have a better right than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, what is that?&rdquo; he asked, evidently puzzled.
The truth never crossed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said I; and I took the red leathern box out
of my pocket, and set it down on the table in front of the duke.
And I put my cigarette between my lips and leaned back in my
chair.</p>

<h4>A Timely Truce.</h4>

<div class="dropcap"><img src="images/13dc.png" alt="I" id=

<p><span class="hide">I</span> think that at first the Duke of
Saint-Maclou could not, as the old saying goes, believe his eyes.
He sat looking from me to the red box, and from the red box back to
my face. Then he stretched out a slow, wavering hand and drew the
box nearer to him till it rested in the circle of his spread-out
arm and directly under his poring gaze. He seemed to shrink from
opening it; but at last he pressed the spring with a covert timid
movement of his finger, and the lid, springing open, revealed the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace.</p>
<p>It seemed to be more brilliant than I had ever seen it, in the
light of the lamp that stood on the table by us; and the duke
looked at it as a magician might at the amulet which had failed
him, or a warrior at the talisman that had proved impotent. And I,
moved to a sudden anger with him for tempting the girl with such a
bribe, said bitterly and scornfully, with fresh indignation rising
in me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a high bid! Strange that you could not buy her
with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid no visible heed to my taunt; and his tone was dull,
bewildered, and heavy as, holding the box still in his curved arm,
he asked slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she give it to you to give to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave it to me to give to your wife.&rdquo; He looked
up with a start. &ldquo;But your wife would not take it of her. And
when I returned from my errand she was gone&mdash;where I know not.
So I decided to send it back to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not follow, or took very little interest in my brief
history. He did not even reiterate his belief that I knew
Marie&rsquo;s whereabouts. His mind was fixed on another point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know she had it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found her with it on the table before
her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I went into her sitting room and found her as I say;
and she was sobbing; and I got from her the story of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and she feared to send it back, lest you should come
and overbear her resistance. I supposed you had frightened her. But
neither would she keep it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bade her not,&rdquo; he put in, in a quick low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like, I prayed her not. Did it need much
cleverness to see what was meant by keeping it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mouth twitched. I saw the tempest rising again in him. But
for a little longer he held it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a fool?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a boy&mdash;do I know nothing of women? And do I
know nothing of men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he ended in a miserable laugh, and then fell again to
tugging his mustache with his shaking hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s bad in both;
and no doubt that&rsquo;s a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that very room the duchess had called Gustave de Berensac a
preacher. Her husband had much the same reproach for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sermons are fine from your mouth,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>And then his self-control gave way. With a sweep of his arm he
drove the necklace from him, so that the box whizzed across the
table, balanced a moment on the edge, and fell crashing on the
ground, while the duke cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s curse on it and you! You&rsquo;ve taken her
from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was danger&mdash;there was something like madness&mdash;in
his aspect as he rose, and, facing me where I sat, went on in tones
still low, but charged with a rage that twisted his features and
lined his white cheeks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a liar or a fool? Have you taken the game for
yourself, or are you fool enough not to see that she has despised
me&mdash;and that miserable necklace&mdash;for you&mdash;because
you&rsquo;ve caught her fancy? My God! and I&rsquo;ve given my life
to it for two years past! And you step in. Why didn&rsquo;t you
keep to my wife? You were welcome to her&mdash;though I&rsquo;d
have shot you all the same for my name&rsquo;s sake. You must have
Marie too, must you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was mad, if ever man was mad, at that moment. But his words
were strong with the force and clear with the insight of his
passion; and the rush of them carried my mind along, and swept it
with them to their own conclusion. Nay, I will not say
that&mdash;for I doubted still; but I doubted as a man who would
deny, not as one who laughs away, a thought. I sat silent, looking,
not at him, but at the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace on the floor.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, while I was still busy with the thought and
dazzled at the revelation, while I sat bemused, before I could
move, his fingers were on my throat, and his face within a foot of
mine, glaring and working as he sent his strength into his arms to
throttle me. For his wife&mdash;and his name&mdash;he would fight a
duel: for the sake of Marie Delhasse he would do murder on an
invited stranger in his house. I struggled to my feet, his grip on
my throat; and I stretched out my hands and caught him under the
shoulders in the armpits, and flung him back against the table, and
thence he reeled on to a large cabinet that was by the wall, and
Stood leaning against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you were a villain,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I
thought you were a gentleman.&rdquo; (I did not stop to consider
the theory implied in that.)</p>
<p>He leaned against the cabinet, red with his exertion and
panting; but he did not come at me again. He dashed his hand across
his forehead and then he said in hoarse breathless tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t leave here alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with a start of recollection, he thrust his hand into his
pocket and brought out a key. He put it in the lock of a drawer of
the cabinet, fumbling after the aperture and missing it more than
once. Then he opened the drawer, took out a pair of dueling
pistols, and laid them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re loaded,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Examine them
for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not move; but I took my little friend out of my
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m attacked,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall
defend myself; but I&rsquo;m not going to fight a duel here,
without witnesses, at the dead of night, in your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it what you like then,&rdquo; said he; and he
snatched up a pistol from the table.</p>
<p>He was beyond remonstrance, influence, or control. I believe
that in a moment he would have fired; and I must have fired also,
or gone to my death as a sheep to the slaughter. But as he spoke
there came a sound, just audible, which made him pause, with his
right hand that held the pistol raised halfway to the level of his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Faint as the sound was, slight as the interruption it would seem
to offer to the full career of a madman&rsquo;s fury, it was yet
enough to check him, to call him back to consciousness of something
else in the world than his balked passion and the man whom he
deemed to have thwarted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>It was the lowest, softest knock at the door&mdash;a knock that
even in asking attention almost shrank from being heard. It was
repeated, louder, yet hardly audibly. The duke, striding on the tip
of his toes, transferred the pistols from the table back to the
drawer, and stood with his hand inside the open drawer: I slid my
weapon into my pocket; and then he trod softly across the floor to
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>And I stooped and picked up the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace and
put it back where it had lain before, pushing its box under the
table by a hasty movement of my foot&mdash;for the duke, after a
nod of intelligence, was already opening the door. I drew back in
the shadow behind it and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the duke.</p>
<p>And then a girl stepped hastily into the room and closed the
door quickly and noiselessly behind her. I saw her face: she was my
old friend Suzanne. When her eyes fell on me, she started in
surprise, as well she might; but the caution and fear, which had
made her knock almost noiseless, her tread silent, and her face all
astrain with alert alarm, held her back from any cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; said the duke. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
nothing to do with you. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Speak low. I thought you would still be up, as you
told me to refill the lamp and have it burning.
There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s something going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a quick, urgent whisper, and in her agitation
remembered no deference in her words of address. &ldquo;Going on?
Where? Do you mean here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I heard nothing here. In the duchess&rsquo;s
dressing-room: it is just under the room where I sleep. I awoke
about half an hour ago, and I heard sounds from there. There was a
sound as of muffled hammering, and then a noise, like the rasping
of a file; and I thought I heard people moving about, but very
cautiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke and I were both listening attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frightened, and lay still a little; but then I got
up&mdash;for the sounds went on&mdash;and put on some clothes, and
came down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you rouse the men? It must be
thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did go to the men&rsquo;s room; but their door was
locked, and I could not make them hear. I did not dare to knock
loud; but I saw a light in the room, under the door; and if
they&rsquo;d been awake they would have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>Suzanne turned a sudden look on me. Then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safe holding the jewels is fixed in the wall of the
duchess&rsquo; dressing room. And&mdash;and Lafleur knows
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke had heard the story with a frowning face; but now a
smile appeared on his lips, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! The jewels are there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace,&rdquo; whispered
Suzanne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the duke; and his eyes met mine, and we
both smiled. A few minutes ago it had not seemed likely that I
should share a joke&mdash;even a rather grim joke&mdash;with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you inclined to
help me to look into this matter? It may be only the girl&rsquo;s
fancy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I heard plainly,&rdquo; Suzanne protested
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one can never trust these rascally
men-servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our business,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be the better for waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment; then he assented gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a pistol out of the drawer, and shut and locked the
drawer. Then he turned to Suzanne and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better go back to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t, I daren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stay here and keep quiet. Mind, not a
sound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He unlocked the drawer again, and gave her what she asked. Then
signing to me to follow him, he opened the door, and we stepped
together into the dark hall, the duke laying his hand on my arm and
whispering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We groped slowly, with careful noiselessness, across the hall to
the foot of the great staircase. There we paused and listened.
There was nothing to be heard. We climbed the first flight of
stairs, and the duke turned sharp to the right. We were now in a
short corridor which ran north and south; three yards ahead of us
was another turn, leading to the west wing of the house. There was
a window by us; the duke gently opened it; and over against us,
across the base of the triangle formed by the building, was another
window, four or five yards away. The window was heavily curtained;
no light could be seen through it. But as we stood listening, the
sounds began&mdash;first the gentle muffled hammering, then the
sound of the file. The duke still held my arm, and we stood
motionless. The sounds went on for a while. Then they ceased. There
was a pause of complete stillness. Then a sharp, though not loud,
click! And, upon this, the duke whispered to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got the safe open. Now they&rsquo;ll find
the small portable safe which holds the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I could make out an amused smile on his pale face. Before I
could speak, he turned and began to crawl away. I followed. We
descended the stairs again to the hall. At the foot he turned
sharply to the left, and came to a standstill in a recess under the
staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait here. Is your pistol all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all right,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>And, as I spoke, the faintest sound spread from the top of the
stairs, and a board creaked under the steps of a man. I was close
against the duke, and I felt him quiver with a stifled laugh.
Meanwhile the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace pressed hard against my
ribs under my tightly buttoned coat.</p>

<p><span class="hide">W</span>hen I look back on the series of
events which I am narrating and try to recover the feelings with
which I was affected in its passage, I am almost amazed and in some
measure ashamed to find how faint is my abhorrence of the Duke of
Saint-Maclou. My indignation wants not the bridle but the whip, and
I have to spur myself on to a becoming vehemence of disapproval. I
attribute my sneaking kindness for him&mdash;for to that and not
much less I must plead guilty&mdash;partly indeed to the revelation
of a passion in him that seemed to leave him hardly responsible for
the wrong he plotted, but far more to the incidents of this night,
in which I was in a manner his comrade and the partner with him in
an adventure. To have stood shoulder to shoulder with a man blinds
his faults&mdash;and the duke bore himself, not merely with the
coolness and courage which I made no doubt of his displaying, but
with a readiness and zest remarkable at any time, but more striking
when they followed on the paroxysm to which I had seen him
helplessly subject. These indications of good in the man mollified
my dislike and attached me to him by a bond which begot toleration
and resists even the clearer and more piercing analysis of memory.
Therefore, when those who speak to me of what he did and sought to
do say what I cannot help admitting to be true, I hold my peace,
thinking that the duke and I have played as partners as well as on
hostile sides, and that I, being no saint, may well hold my tongue
about the faults of a fellow-sinner. Moreover,&mdash;and this is
the thing of all strongest to temper or to twist my judgment of
him,&mdash;I feel often as though it were he who laid his finger on
my blind eyes and bade me look up and see where lay my happiness.
For it is strange how long a man can go without discovering his own
undermost desire. Yet, when seen, how swift it grows!</p>
<p>Quiet and still we stood in the bay of the staircase, and the
steps over our heads creaked under the feet of the men who came
down. The duke&rsquo;s hand was on my arm, restraining me, and he
held it there till the feet had passed above us and the stealthy
tread landed on the marble flagging of the hall. We thrust our
heads out and peered through the darkness. I saw the figures of two
men, one following the other toward the front door; this the first
and taller unfastened and noiselessly opened; and he and his
fellow, whom, by the added light which entered, I perceived to be
carrying a box or case of moderate size, waited for a moment on the
threshold. Then they passed out, drawing the door close after
them.</p>
<p>Still the duke held me back, and we rested where we were three
or four minutes. Then he whispered, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and we
stole across the hall after them and found ourselves outside. It
must have been about half-past two o&rsquo;clock in the morning;
there was no moon and it was rather dark. The duke turned sharp to
the left and led me to the bypath, and there, a couple of hundred
yards ahead of us, we saw a cube of light that came from a dark
lantern.</p>
<p>The duke&rsquo;s face was dimly visible, and an amused smile
played on his lips as he said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lafleur and Pierre! They think they&rsquo;ve got the
necklace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this the meaning of Pierre&rsquo;s appearance in the role of
my successor? The idea suggested itself to me in a moment, and I
strove to read my companion&rsquo;s face for a confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see where they go,&rdquo; he whispered, and
then laid his finger on his lips. Amusement sounded in his voice;
indeed it was impossible not to perceive the humor of the position,
when I felt the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace against my own ribs.</p>
<p>We were walking now under cover of the trees which lined the
sides of the path, so that no backward glance could discover us to
the thieves; and I was wondering how long we were thus to dog their
steps, when suddenly they turned to the left about fifty yards
short of the spot where old Jean&rsquo;s cottage stood, and
disappeared from our sight. We emerged into the path, the duke
taking the lead. He was walking more briskly now, and I saw him
examine his pistol. When we came where the fellows had turned, we
followed in their track.</p>
<p>The first distant hint of approaching morning caught the tops of
the trees above us, turning them from black to a deep chill gray,
as we paused to listen. Our pursuit had brought us directly behind
the cottage, which now stood about a hundred yards on the right;
and then we came upon them&mdash;or rather suddenly stopped and
crouched down to avoid coming upon them&mdash;where they were
squatting on the ground with a black iron box between them, and the
lantern&rsquo;s light thrown on the keyhole of the box. Lafleur
held the lantern; Pierre&rsquo;s hand was near the lock, and I
presumed&mdash;I could not see&mdash;that he held some instrument
with which he meant to open it. A ring of trees framed the picture,
and the men sat in a hollow, well hidden from the path even had it
been high day.</p>
<p>The Duke of Saint-Maclou touched my arm, and I leaned forward to
look in his face. He nodded, and, brushing aside the trees, we
sprang out upon the astonished fellows. Fora moment they did not
move, struck motionless with surprise, while we stood over them,
pistols in hand. We had caught them fair and square. Expecting no
interruption, they had guarded against none. Their weapons were in
their pockets, their hands busy with their job. They sprang up the
next moment; but the duke&rsquo;s muzzle covered Lafleur, and mine
was leveled full at Pierre. A second later Lafleur fell on his
knees with a cry for mercy; the little man stood quite still, his
arms by his side and the iron box hard by his feet. Lafleur&rsquo;s
protestations and lamentations began to flow fast. Pierre shrugged
his shoulders. The duke advanced, and I kept pace with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eye on that fellow, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said the
duke; and then he put his left hand in his pocket, took out a key
and flung it in Lafleur&rsquo;s face. It struck him sharply between
the eyes, and he whined again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the box,&rdquo; said the duke. &ldquo;Open
it&mdash;do you hear? This instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With shaking hands the fellow dragged the box from where it lay
by Pierre&rsquo;s feet, and dropping on his knees began to fumble
with the lock. At last he contrived to unlock it, and raised the
lid. The duke sprang forward and, catching him by the nape of the
neck, crammed his head down into the box, bidding him,
&ldquo;Look&mdash;look&mdash;look!&rdquo; And while he said it he
laughed, and took advantage of Lafleur&rsquo;s posture to give him
four or five hearty kicks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s empty!&rdquo; cried Lafleur, surprise rescuing
him for an instant from the other emotions to which his position
gave occasion. And, as he spoke, for the first time Pierre started,
turning an eager gaze toward the box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s empty,&rdquo; said the duke. &ldquo;The
necklace isn&rsquo;t there, is it? Now, tell me all about it, or
I&rsquo;ll put a bullet through your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the story came: disentangled from the excuses and prayers,
it was simply that Pierre was no footman but a noted
thief&mdash;that he had long meditated an attack on the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace; had made Lafleur&rsquo;s acquaintance in
Paris, corrupted his facile virtue, and, with the aid of forged
testimonials, presented himself in the character in which I had
first made his acquaintance. The rascals had counted on the
duke&rsquo;s preoccupation with Marie Delhasse for their
opportunity. The duke smiled to hear it. Pierre listened to the
whole story without a word of protest or denial; his
accomplice&rsquo;s cowardly attempt to present him as the only
culprit gained no more notice than another shrug and a softly
muttered oath. &ldquo;Destiny,&rdquo; the little man seemed to say
in the eloquent movement of his shoulders; while the growing light
showed his beady eyes fixed, full and unfaltering, on me.</p>
<p>Lafleur&rsquo;s prayers died away. The duke, still smiling, set
his pistol against the wretch&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you deserve,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And Lafleur, groveling, caught him by the knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me! Don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; he
implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the duke, in the tone of a man
willing to hear the other side, but certain that he would not be
convinced by it. &ldquo;Why not? We find you stealing&mdash;and we
shoot you as you try to escape. I see nothing unnatural or illegal
in it, Lafleur. Nor do I see anything in favor of leaving you
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the pistol pressed still on Lafleur&rsquo;s forehead.
Whether his master meant to shoot, I know not&mdash;although I
believe he did. But Lafleur had little doubt of his purpose; for he
hastened to play his best card, and, clinging still to the
duke&rsquo;s knees, cried desperately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll spare me, I&rsquo;ll tell you where she
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke&rsquo;s arm fell to his side; and in a changed voice,
from which the cruel bantering had fled, while eager excitement
filled its place, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Where who is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady&mdash;Mlle. Delhasse. A girl I know&mdash;there
in Avranches&mdash;saw her go. She is there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, man, where?&rdquo; roared the duke, stamping his
foot, and menacing the wretch again with his pistol.</p>
<p>I turned to listen, forgetful of quiet little Pierre and his
alert beady eyes; yet I kept the pistol on him.</p>
<p>And Lafleur cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the convent&mdash;at the convent, on the shores of the
bay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried the duke, and his eyes suddenly
turned and flashed on mine; and I saw that the necklace was
forgotten, that our partnership was ended, and that I again, and no
longer the cowering creature before him, was the enemy. And I also,
hearing that Marie Delhasse was at the convent, was telling myself
that I was a fool not to have thought of it before, and wondering
what new impulse had seized the duke&rsquo;s wayward mind.</p>
<p>Thus neither the duke nor I was attending to the business of the
moment. But there was a man of busy brain, whose life taught him to
profit by the slips of other men and to let pass no opportunities.
Our carelessness gave one now&mdash;a chance of escape, and a
chance of something else too. For, while my negligent hand dropped
to my side and my eyes were seeking to read the duke&rsquo;s face,
the figure opposite me must have been moving. Softly must a deft
hand have crept to a pocket; softly came forth the hidden weapon.
There was a report loud and sudden; and then another. And with the
first, Lafleur, who was kneeling at the duke&rsquo;s feet and
looking up to see how his shaft had sped, flung his arms wildly
over his head, gave a shriek, and fell dead&mdash;his head,
half-shattered, striking the iron box as he fell sideways in a heap
on the ground.</p>
<p>The duke sprang back with an oath, whose sound was engulfed in
the second discharge of Pierre&rsquo;s pistol: and I felt myself
struck in the right arm; and my weapon fell to the ground, while I
clutched the wounded limb with my left hand.</p>
<p>The duke, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation and bewilderment,
raised his pistol and fired; but the active little scoundrel was
safe among the trees, and we heard the twigs cracking and the
leaves rustling as he pushed his way through the wood. He was
gone&mdash;scot free for us, but with his score to Lafleur well
paid. I swayed where I stood, to and fro: the pain was
considerable, and things seemed to go round before my eyes; yet I
turned to my companion, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him! He&rsquo;ll get off! I&rsquo;m hit; I
can&rsquo;t run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke stood still, frowning; then he slowly dropped his
smoking pistol into his pocket. For a moment longer he stood, and a
smile broadened on his face as he raised his eyes to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; he said briefly; and his glance rested on
me for a moment in defiant significance. And then, without another
word, he turned on his heel. He took no heed of Lafleur&rsquo;s
dead body, that seemed to fondle the box, huddling it in a ghastly
embrace, nor of me, who swayed and tottered and sank on the ground
by the corpse. With set lips and eager eyes he passed me, taking
the road by which we had come. And I, hugging my wounded arm, with
open eyes and parted lips, saw him dive in among the trees and
disappear toward the house. And I looked round on the iron box and
the dead body&mdash;two caskets robbed of all that made them more
than empty lumber.</p>
<p>Minute followed minute; and then I heard the hoofs of a horse
galloping at full speed along the road from the house toward
Avranches. Lafleur was dead and done with; Pierre might go his
ways; I lay fainting in the wood; the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace was
still against my side. What recked the Duke of Saint-Maclou of all
that? I knew, as I heard the thud of the hoofs on the road, that by
the time the first reddening rays reached over the horizon he would
be at the convent, seeking the woman who was all the world to
him.</p>
<p>And I sat there helpless, fearful of what would befall her. For
what could a convent full of women avail against his mastering
rage? And a sudden sharp pang ran through me, startling even myself
in its intensity; so that I cried out aloud, raising my sound arm
in the air toward Heaven, like a man who swears a vow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, no! By God, no&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he dead man lay there, embracing the
empty box that had brought him to his death; and for many minutes I
sat within a yard of him, detained by the fascination and grim
mockery of the picture no less than by physical weakness and a
numbness of my brain. My body refused to act, and my mind hardly
urged its indolent servant. I was in sore distress for Marie
Delhasse,&mdash;my vehement cry witnessed it,&mdash;yet I had not
the will to move to her aid; will and power both seemed to fail me.
I could fear, I could shrink with horror, but I could not act; nor
did I move till the increasing pain of my wound drove me, as it
might any unintelligent creature, to scramble to my feet and seek,
half-blindly, for some place that should afford shelter and
succor.</p>
<p>Leaving Lafleur and the box where they lay, a pretty spectacle
for a moralist, I stumbled through the wood back to the path, and
stood there in helpless vacillation. At the house I should find
better attendance, but old Jean&rsquo;s cottage was nearer. The
indolence of weakness gained the day, and I directed my steps
toward the cottage, thinking now, so far as I can recollect, of
none of the exciting events of the night nor even of what the
future still held, but purely and wholly of the fact that in the
cottage I should find a fire and a bed. The root-instincts of the
natural man&mdash;the primeval elementary wants&mdash;asserted
their supremacy and claimed a monopoly of my mind, driving out all
rival emotions, and with a mighty sigh of relief and content I
pushed open the door of the cottage, staggered across to the fire
and sank down on the stool by it, thanking Heaven for so much, and
telling myself that soon, very soon, I should feel strong enough to
make my way into the inner room and haul out Jean&rsquo;s pallet
and set it by the fire and stretch my weary limbs, and, if the pain
of my wound allowed me, go to sleep. Beyond that my desires did not
reach, and I forgot all my fears save the one dread that I was too
weak for the desired effort. Certainly it is hard for a man to
think himself a hero!</p>
<p>I took no note of time, but I must have sat where I was for many
minutes, before I heard someone moving in the inner room. I was
very glad; of course it was Jean, and Jean, I told myself with
luxurious self-congratulation, would bring the bed for me, and put
something on my wound, and maybe give me a chink of some fine hot
cognac that would spread life through my veins. Thus I should be
comfortable and able to sleep, and forget all the shadowy
people&mdash;they seemed but shadows half-real&mdash;that I had
been troubling my brain about: the duke, and Marie, whose face
danced for a moment before my eyes, and that dead fellow who hugged
the box so ludicrously. So I tried to call to Jean, but the trouble
was too great, and, as he would be sure to come out soon, I waited;
and I blinked at the smoldering wood-ashes in the fire till my eyes
closed and the sleep was all but come, despite the smart of my arm
and the ache in my unsupported back.</p>
<p>But just before I had forgotten everything the door of the inner
room creaked and opened. My side was toward it and I did not look
round. I opened my eyes and feebly waved my left hand. Then a voice
came, clear and fresh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean, is it you? Well, is the duke at the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must be dreaming; that was my immediate conviction, for the
voice that I heard was a voice I knew well, but one not likely to
be heard here, in Jean&rsquo;s cottage, at four o&rsquo;clock in
the morning. Decidedly I was dreaming, and as in order to dream a
man must be asleep, I was pleased at the idea and nodded happily,
smiling and blinking in self-congratulation. But that pleasant
minute of illusion was my last; for the voice cried in tones too
full of animation, too void of dreamy vagueness, too real and
actual to let me longer set them down as made of my own brain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven! Why, it&rsquo;s Mr. Aycon! How in the world do
you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To feel surprise at the Duchess of Saint-Maclou doing anything
which she might please to do or being anywhere that the laws of
Nature rendered it possible she should be, was perhaps a
disposition of mind of which I should have been by this time cured;
yet I was surprised to find her standing in the doorway that led
from Jean&rsquo;s little bedroom dressed in a neat walking gown and
a very smart hat, her hands clasped in the surprise which she
shared with me and her eyes gleaming with an amused delight which
found, I fear, no answer in my heavy bewildered gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting warm,&rdquo; said I at first, but then
I made an effort to rouse myself. &ldquo;I was a bit hurt, you
know,&rdquo; I went on; &ldquo;that little villain
Pierre&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt!&rdquo; cried the duchess, springing forward.
&ldquo;How? Oh, my dear Mr. Aycon, how pale you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that remark of the duchess&rsquo;, I remember nothing
which occurred for a long while. In fact, just as I had apprehended
that I was awake, that the duchess was real, and that it was most
remarkable to find her in Jean&rsquo;s cottage, I fainted, and the
duchess, the cottage, and everything else vanished from sight and
mind.</p>
<p>When next I became part of the waking world I found myself on
the sofa of the little room in the duke&rsquo;s house which I was
beginning to know so well. I felt very comfortable: my arm was
neatly bandaged, I wore a clean shirt. Suzanne was spreading a meal
on the table, and the duchess, in a charming morning gown, was
smiling at me and humming a tune. The clock on the mantelpiece
marked a quarter to eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know all about it,&rdquo; said the duchess,
perceiving my revival. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it all from Suzanne
and Jean&mdash;or anyhow I can guess the rest. And you
mustn&rsquo;t tire yourself by talking. I had you brought here so
that you might be well looked after; because we&rsquo;re so much
indebted to you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the duke here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no; it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; nodded the
duchess. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and I do not
care&mdash;where the duke is. Drink this milk, Mr. Aycon. Your
arm&rsquo;s not very bad, you know&mdash;Jean says it isn&rsquo;t,
I mean&mdash;but you&rsquo;d better have milk first, and something
to eat when you feel stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess appeared to be in excellent spirits. She caught up a
bit of toast from the table, poured out a cup of coffee, and, still
moving about, began a light breakfast, with every sign of appetite
and enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come back?&rdquo; said I, looking at her in
persistent surprise.</p>
<p>Suzanne put the cushions behind my back in a more comfortable
position, smiled kindly on us, and left us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;I have for the
present, Mr. Aycon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but the duke&mdash;&rdquo; I stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind the duke,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Besides, he may not come. It&rsquo;s rather nice that
you&rsquo;re just a little hurt. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr.
Aycon? Just a little, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; was all I found to say. The reason was not
clear to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the first place, because you can&rsquo;t fight
till your arm&rsquo;s well&mdash;oh, yes, of course Armand was
going to fight you&mdash;and, in the second place, you can and must
stay here. There&rsquo;s no harm in it, while you&rsquo;re ill, you
see; Armand can&rsquo;t say there is. It&rsquo;s rather funny,
isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Aycon?&rdquo; and she munched a morsel of
toast, and leaned her elbows on the table and sent a sparkling
glance across at me, for all the world as she had done on the first
night I knew her. The cares of the world did not gall the shoulders
of Mme. de Saint-Maclou.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are you here?&rdquo; said I, sticking to my
point.</p>
<p>The duchess set down the cup of coffee which she had been
sipping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not particular,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But I told
the Mother Superior exactly what I told the duke. She
wouldn&rsquo;t listen any more than he would. However, I was
resolved; so I came here. I don&rsquo;t see where else I could go,
do you, Mr. Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell the Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess stretched one hand across the table, clenching her
small fist and tapping gently with it on the cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing that I will not do, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo;
said she, a touch of red coming in her cheeks and her lips set in
obstinate lines. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether the house is my
house or anybody else&rsquo;s house, or an inn&mdash;yes, or a
convent either. But I will not be under the same roof with Marie
Delhasse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And her declaration finished, the duchess nodded most
emphatically, and turned to her cup again.</p>
<p>The name of Marie Delhasse, shot forth from Mme. de
Saint-Maclou&rsquo;s pouting lips, pierced the cloud that had
seemed to envelop my brain. I sat up on the sofa and looked eagerly
at the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw her, then, at the convent?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I met her in the chapel. Really, I should have
expected to be safe from her there. And the Mother would not turn
her out!&rdquo; And then the duchess, by a sudden transition, said
to me, with a half-apologetic, half challenging smile: &ldquo;You
got my note, I suppose, Mr. Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute I regarded the duchess. And I smiled, and my smile
turned to a laugh as I answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I got the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But I suppose I must
forgive you now. You&rsquo;ve been so brave, and you&rsquo;re so
much hurt.&rdquo; And the duchess&rsquo; eyes expressed a
gratifying admiration of my powers.</p>
<p>I fingered my arm, which lay comfortably enough in the bandages
and the sling that Suzanne&rsquo;s care had provided for it. And I
rose to my feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; cried the duchess,
rising also and coming to where I stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, but I must!&rdquo; said I, looking at the clock.
&ldquo;The duke&rsquo;s got four hours&rsquo; start of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with my husband now?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should fight him; anyhow, you
can&rsquo;t fight him till your arm is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess&rsquo; words struck on my ear and her dainty little
figure was before my eyes, but my thoughts were absent from
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;By this time he&rsquo;ll
be at the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A frown gathered on the duchess&rsquo; face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What concern is it of yours?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I mean, what good can you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly talk to you about it&mdash;&rdquo; I began
awkwardly; but the duchess saved me the trouble of finishing my
sentence, for she broke in angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as if I believe that! Mr. Aycon, why are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see that the duke
doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are very anxious&mdash;and very good,
aren&rsquo;t you? Yes, and very chivalrous! Mr. Aycon, I
don&rsquo;t care what he does;&rdquo; and she looked at me
defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; said I, and seeing my hat on the cabinet
by the wall, I walked across the room and stretched out my hand for
it. The duchess darted after me and stood between my hat and
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you care?&rdquo; she asked, with a stamp of her
small foot.</p>
<p>There were, no doubt, many most sound and plausible reasons for
caring&mdash;reasons independent of any private feelings of my own
in regard to Marie Delhasse; but not one of them did I give to the
duchess. I stood before her, looking, I fear, very embarrassed, and
avoiding her accusing eyes.</p>
<p>Then the duchess flung her head back, and with passionate scorn
said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re in love with the woman
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this accusation also I made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really going?&rdquo; she asked, her voice
suddenly passing to a note of entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said I obstinately, callously,
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go!&rdquo; cried the duchess. &ldquo;And never let
me see you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved aside, and I sprang forward and seized my hat. I took
no notice of the duchess, and, turning, I walked straight toward
the door. But before I reached it the duchess flung herself on the
sofa and buried her face in the cushions. I would not leave her
like that, so I stood and waited; but my tongue still refused to
find excuses, and still I was in a fever to be off.</p>
<p>But the duchess rose again and stood upright. She was rather
pale and her lips quivered, but she held out her hand to me with a
smile. And suddenly I understood what I was doing, and that for the
second time the proud little lady before me saw herself left and
neglected for the sake of that woman whose presence made even a
convent uninhabitable to her; and the bitter wound that her pride
suffered was declared in her bearing and in the pathetic effort at
dignity which she had summoned up to hide her pain. Yet, although
on this account I was sorry for her, I discerned nothing beyond
hurt pride, and was angry at the pride for the sake of Marie
Delhasse, and when I spoke it was in defense of Marie Delhasse, and
not in comfort to the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not what you think,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The duchess drew herself up to her full height, making the most
of her inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must
forgive me if I do not discuss that.&rdquo; And she paused, and
then added, with a curl of her lip: &ldquo;You and my husband can
settle that between you;&rdquo; and with a motion of her hand she
signed to me to leave her.</p>
<p>Looking back on the matter, I do not know that I had any reason
to be ashamed or to feel myself in any sort a traitor to the
duchess. Yet some such feelings I had as I backed out of the room
leaving her standing there in unwonted immobility, her eyes haughty
and cold, her lips set, her grace congealed to stateliness, her gay
agility frozen to proud stiffness.</p>
<p>And I left her thus standing in obedience to the potent yet
still but half-understood spell which drew me from her side and
would not suffer me to rest, while the Duke of Saint-Maclou was
working his devices in the valley beneath the town of
Avranches.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>he moment I found myself outside the
house&mdash;and I must confess that, for reasons which I have
indicated, it was a relief to me to find myself there&mdash;I
hastened to old Jean&rsquo;s cottage. The old man was eating his
breakfast; his stolidity was unshaken by the events of the night;
he manifested nothing beyond a mild satisfaction that the two
rascals had justified his opinion of them, and a resigned regret
that Pierre had not shared the fate of Lafleur. He told me that his
inquiries after Marie Delhasse had been fruitless, and added that
he supposed there would be a police inquiry into the attempted
robbery and the consequent death of Lafleur; indeed he was of
opinion that the duke had gone to Avranches to arrange for it as
much as to prosecute his search for Marie. I seized the opportunity
to suggest that I should be a material witness, and urged him to
give me one of the duke&rsquo;s horses to carry me to Avranches. He
grumbled at my request, declaring that I should end by getting him
into trouble; but a few francs overcame his scruples, and he
provided me with a sturdy animal, which I promised to bring or send
back in the course of the day.</p>
<p>Great as my impatience was, I was compelled to spend the first
hour of my arrival at Avranches under the doctor&rsquo;s hands. He
discovered to my satisfaction that the bullet had not lodged in my
arm and that my hurt was no more than a flesh-wound, which would,
if all went well, heal in a few days. He enjoined perfect rest and
freedom from worry and excitement. I thanked him, bowed myself out,
mounted again, and rode to the hotel, where I left my horse with
instructions for its return to its owner. Then, at my best speed, I
hastened down the hill again, reached the grounds of the convent,
and approached the door. Perfect rest and freedom from excitement
were unattainable until I had learned whether Marie Delhasse was
still safe within the old white walls which I saw before me; for,
though I could not trace how the change in me had come, nor track
its growth, I knew now that if she were there the walls held what
was of the greatest moment to me in all the world, and that if she
were not there the world was a hell to me until I found her.</p>
<p>I was about to ring the bell, when from the gate of the
burial-ground the Mother Superior came at a slow pace. The old
woman was frowning as she walked, and her frown deepened at sight
of me. But I, caring nothing for what she thought, ran up to her,
crying before I had well reached her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Marie Delhasse still here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mother stopped dead, and regarded me with
disapprobation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business is it of yours, sir, where the young woman
is?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean her no harm,&rdquo; I urged eagerly. &ldquo;If she
is safe here, I ask to know no more; I don&rsquo;t even ask to see
her. Is she here? The Duchess of Saint-Maclou told me that you
refused to send her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid that I should send away any sinner who will
find refuge here,&rdquo; she said solemnly. &ldquo;You have seen
the duchess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she is at home. But Mlle. Delhasse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old woman would not be hurried. She asked again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What concern have you, sir, with Marie
Delhasse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked her in the face as I answered plainly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save her from the Duke of Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from her own mother, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, above all from her own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman started at my words; but there was no change in
the level calm of her voice as she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why would you rescue her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the same reason that any gentleman would, if he
could. If you want more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held up her hand to silence me; but her look was gentler and
her voice softer, as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, sir, cannot save, and I cannot save, those who will
not let God himself save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I cried in a frenzy of fear and
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had prayed for her, and talked with her. I thought I
had seen grace in her. Well, I know not. It is true that she acted
as her mother bade her. But I fear all is not well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray you to speak plainly. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know where she is. What I know, sir, you shall
know, for I believe you come in honesty. This morning&mdash;some
two hours ago&mdash;a carriage drove from the town here. Mme.
Delhasse was in it, and with her the Duke of Saint-Maclou. I could
not refuse to let the woman see her daughter. They spoke together
for a time; and then they called me, and Marie&mdash;yes, Marie
herself&mdash;begged me to let her see the duke. So they came here
where we stand, and I stood a few yards off. They talked earnestly
in low tones. And at last Marie came to me (the others remaining
where they were), and took my hand and kissed it, thanking me and
bidding me adieu. I was grieved, sir, for I trusted that the girl
had found peace here; and she was in the way to make us love her.
&lsquo;Does your mother bid you go?&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;And will
she save you from all harm?&rsquo; And she answered: &lsquo;I go of
my own will, Mother; but I go hoping to return.&rsquo; &lsquo;You
swear that you go of your own will?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Yes, of
my own will,&rsquo; she said firmly; but she was near to weeping as
she spoke. Yet what could I do? I could but tell her that our
door&mdash;God&rsquo;s door&mdash;was never shut. That I told her;
and with a heavy heart, being able to do nothing else, I let her
go. I pray God no harm come of it. But I thought the man&rsquo;s
face wore a look of triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it shall not wear it
for long! Which way did they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the road by the side of the bay, leading away
from Avranches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way. I watched the carriage and its dust till I saw
it no more, because of the wood that lies between here and the
road. You pursue them, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the world&rsquo;s end, madame, if I must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed and opened her lips to speak, but no words came; and
without more, I turned and left her, and set my face to follow the
carriage. I was, I think, half-mad with anger and bewilderment, for
I did not think that it would be time well spent to ascend to the
town and obtain a vehicle or a horse; but I pressed on afoot, weary
and in pain as I was, along the hot white road. For now indeed my
heart was on fire, and I knew that beside Marie Delhasse everything
was nothing. So at first imperceptibly, slowly, and unobserved, but
at the last with a swift resistless rush, the power of her beauty
and of the soul that I had seemed to see in her won upon me; and
that moment, when I thought that she had yielded to her enemy and
mine, was the flowering and bloom of my love for her.</p>
<p>Where had they gone? Not to the duke&rsquo;s house, or I should
have met them as I rode down earlier in the morning. Then where?
France was wide, and the world wider: my steps were slow. Where lay
the use of the chase? In the middle of the road, when I had gone
perhaps a mile, I stopped dead. I was beaten and sick at heart, and
I searched for a nook of shade by the wayside, and flung myself on
the ground; and the ache of my arm was the least of my pain.</p>
<p>As I lay there, my eye caught sight of a cloud of dust on the
road. For a moment I scanned it eagerly, and then fell back with a
curse of disappointment. It was caused by a man on a
horse&mdash;and the man was not the duke. But in an instant I was
sitting up again&mdash;for as the rider drew nearer, trotting
briskly along, his form and air was familiar to me; and when he
came opposite to me, I sprang up and ran out to meet him, crying
out to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustave! Gustave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Gustave de Berensac, my friend. He reined in his horse
and greeted me&mdash;and he greeted me without surprise, but not
without apparent displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should find you here still,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I rode over to seek you. Surely you are not at the
duchess&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone was eloquent of remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been staying at the inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the inn?&rdquo; he repeated, looking at me curiously.
&ldquo;And is the duchess at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s at home now. How come you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend, and how comes your arm in a sling? Well,
you shall have my story first. I expect it will prove shorter. I am
staying at Pontorson with a friend who is quartered
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you went to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave leaned clown to me, and spoke in a low impressive
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a blow.
The day after I got to Paris I heard from Lady Cynthia. She&rsquo;s
going to be married to a countryman of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave looked very doleful. I murmured condolence, though in
truth I cared, just then, not a straw about the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I seized the first
opportunity for a little change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Gustave&rsquo;s mournful eye ranged over the
landscape. Then he said, in a patient, sorrowful voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said the duchess was at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s at home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I ask again, because as I passed the inn on the way
between here and Pontorson I saw in the courtyard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, what?&rdquo; cried I in sudden eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, man? I saw a carriage with some
luggage on it, and it looked like the duke&rsquo;s,
and&mdash;Hallo! Gilbert, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait, I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; I called,
already three or four yards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t heard how you got your
arm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now. I can&rsquo;t
wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lethargy had vanished; I was hot to be on my way again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the man mad?&rdquo; he cried; and he put his horse to
a quick walk to keep up with me.</p>
<p>I stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take all day to tell you the story,&rdquo; I
said impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I should like to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. Look here, Gustave, the duchess
knows. Go and see her. I must go on now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the puzzled mournful eyes of the rejected lover and
bewildered friend I thought I saw a little gleam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duchess?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s all alone. The duke&rsquo;s not
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the duke?&rdquo; he asked; but, as it struck me,
now rather in precaution than in curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to see,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>And with hope and resolution born again in my heart I broke into
a fair run, and, with a wave of my hand, left Gustave in the middle
of the road, staring after me and plainly convinced that I was mad.
Perhaps I was not far from that state. Mad or not, in any case
after three minutes I thought no more of my good friend Gustave de
Berensac, nor of aught else, save the inn outside Pontorson, just
where the old road used to turn toward Mont St. Michel. To that
goal I pressed on, forgetting my weariness and my pain. For it
might be that the carriage would still stand in the yard, and that
in the house I should come upon the object of my search.</p>
<p>Half an hour&rsquo;s walk brought me to the inn, and there, to
my joy, I saw the carriage drawn up under a shed side by side with
the inn-keeper&rsquo;s market cart. The horses had been taken out;
there was no servant in sight. I walked up to the door of the inn
and passed through it. And I called for wine.</p>
<p>A big stout man, wearing a blouse, came out to meet me. The inn
was a large one, and the inn-keeper was evidently a man of some
consideration, although he wore a blouse. But I did not like the
look of him, for he had shifty eyes and a bloated face. Without a
word he brought me what I ordered and set it down in a little room
facing the stable yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose carriage is that under your shed?&rdquo; I asked,
sipping my wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the carriage of the Duke of Saint-Maclou,
sir,&rdquo; he answered readily enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke is here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you business with him, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did but ask you a simple question,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Ah! what&rsquo;s that? Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been looking out of the window, and my sudden exclamation
was caused by this&mdash;that the door of a stable which faced me
had opened very gently, and but just wide enough to allow a face to
appear for an instant and then disappear. And it seemed to me that
I knew the face, although the sight of it had been too short to
make me sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see, sir?&rdquo; asked the inn-keeper. (The
name on his signboard was Jacques Bontet.)</p>
<p>I turned and faced him full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw someone look out of the stable,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless the stable-boy,&rdquo; he answered; and his
manner was so ordinary, unembarrassed, and free from alarm, that I
doubted whether my eyes had not played me a trick, or my
imagination played one upon my eyes.</p>
<p>Be that as it might, I had no time to press my host further at
that moment; for I heard a step behind me and a voice I knew
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bontet, who is this gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned. In the doorway of the room stood the Duke of
Saint-Maclou. He was in the same dress as when he had parted from
me; he was dusty, his face was pale, and the skin had made bags
under his eyes. But he stood looking at me composedly, with a smile
on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is my friend Mr. Aycon.
Bontet, bring me some wine, too, that I may drink with my
friend.&rdquo; And he added, addressing me: &ldquo;You will find
our good Bontet most obliging. He is a tenant of mine, and he will
do anything to oblige me and my friends. Isn&rsquo;t it so,
Bontet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow grunted a surly and none too respectful assent, and
left the room to fetch the duke his wine. Silence followed on his
departure for some seconds. Then the duke came up to where I stood,
folded his arms, and looked me full in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to lose the pleasure of your company,
sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will depart from here alone,&rdquo; I retorted,
&ldquo;you shall find it the easiest thing in the world. For, in
truth, it is not desire for your society that brings me
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted a hand and tugged at his mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, perhaps, been to the convent?&rdquo; he
hazarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just come from there,&rdquo; I rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not an Englishman,&rdquo; said he, curling the end
of the mustache, &ldquo;and I do not know how plain an intimation
need be to discourage one of your resolute race. For my part, I
should have thought that when a lady accepts the escort of one
gentleman, it means that she does not desire that of
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this with a great air and an assumption of dignity that
contrasted strongly with the unrestrained paroxysms of the night
before. I take it that success&mdash;or what seems such&mdash;may
transform a man as though it changed his very skin. But I was not
skilled to cross swords with him in talk of that kind, so I put my
hands in my pockets and leaned against the shutter and said
bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows what lies you told her, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His white face suddenly flushed; but he held himself in and
retorted with a sneer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disabled right arm gives a man fine courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I can aim as well with my
left;&rdquo; and that indeed was not very far from the truth. And I
went on: &ldquo;Is she here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mme. and Mlle. Delhasse are both here, under my
escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see Mlle. Delhasse,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>He answered me in low tones, but with the passion in him closer
to the surface now and near on boiling up through the thin film of
his self-restraint:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as I live, you shall never see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I cared not, for my heart leaped in joy at his words. They
meant to me that he dared not let me see her; that, be the meaning
of her consent to go with him what it might, yet he dared not match
his power over her against mine. And whence came the power he
feared? It could be mine only if I had touched her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume she may see whom she will,&rdquo; said I still
carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother will protect her from you with my
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a minute. Then I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not leave here without seeing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a pause followed my words till the duke, fixing his eyes on
mine, answered significantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you leave here alive to-night, you are welcome to take
her with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I understood, and I nodded my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My left arm is as sound as yours,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;and, maybe, better practiced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our eyes met again, and the agreement was sealed. The duke was
about to speak again, when a sudden thought struck me. I put my
hand in my pocket and drew out the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace. And I
flung it on the table before me, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me return that to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke stood regarding the necklace for a moment, as it lay
gleaming and glittering on the wooden table in the bare inn parlor.
Then he stepped up to the table, but at the moment I cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t steal her away
before&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we fight? I will not, on my honor.&rdquo; He
paused and added: &ldquo;For there is one thing I want more even
than her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could guess what that was.</p>
<p>And then he put out his hand, took up the necklace, and thrust
it carelessly into the pocket of his coat. And looking across the
room, I saw the inn-keeper, Jacques Bontet, standing in the doorway
and staring with all his eyes at the spot on the table where the
glittering thing had for a moment lain; and as the fellow set down
the wine he had brought for the duke, I swear that he trembled as a
man who has seen a ghost; for he spilled some of the wine and
chinked the bottle against the glass. But while I stared at him,
the duke lifted his glass and bowed to me, saying, with a smile and
as though he jested in some phrase of extravagant friendship for
me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May nothing less than death part you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I drank the toast with him, saying &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="hide">A</span>s Bontet the inn-keeper set the wine
on the table before the Duke of Saint-Maclou, the big clock in the
hall of the inn struck noon. It is strange to me, even now when the
story has grown old in my memory, to recall all that happened
before the hands of that clock pointed again to twelve. And last
year when I revisited the neighborhood and found a neat new house
standing on the site of the ramshackle inn, I could not pass by
without a queer feeling in my throat; for it was there that the
results of the duchess&rsquo; indiscretion finally worked
themselves out to their unexpected, fatal, and momentous ending.
Seldom, as I should suppose, has such a mixed skein of good and
evil, of fatality and happiness, been spun from material no more
substantial than a sportive lady&rsquo;s idle freak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Aycon,&rdquo; said the duke, after we had
drunk our toast, &ldquo;I have had a message from the magistrate at
Avranches requesting our presence to-morrow morning at eleven
o&rsquo;clock. An inquiry has to be held into the death of that
rascal Lafleur, and our evidence must be taken. It is a mere
formality, the magistrate is good enough to assure me, and I have
assured him that we shall neither of us allow anything to interfere
with our waiting on him, if we can possibly do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have sent no other message myself,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will also,&rdquo; continued the duke, &ldquo;send word
by Bontet here to those two friends of mine at Pontorson. It would
be dull for you to dine alone with me, and, as the evening promises
to be fine, I will ask them to be here by five o&rsquo;clock, and
we will have a stroll on the sands and a nearer look at the Mount
before our meal. They are officers who are quartered
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their presence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will add greatly to
the pleasure of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, if you will excuse me, I shall take an hour or
two&rsquo;s rest. We missed our sleep last night, and we should
wish to be fresh when our guests arrive. If I might advise
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am about to breakfast, after that I may follow your
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve not breakfasted? You can&rsquo;t do
better, then. <em>Au revoir</em>;&rdquo; and with a bow he left me,
calling to Bontet to follow him upstairs and wait for the note
which was to go to the officers at Pontorson. It must be admitted
that the duke conducted the necessary arrangements with much
tact.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour my breakfast was before me, and I seated
myself with my back to the door and my face to the window. I had
plenty to think about as I ate; but my chief anxiety was by some
means to obtain an interview with Marie Delhasse, not with a view
to persuading her to attempt escape with me before the
evening&mdash;for I had made up my mind that the issue with the
duke must be faced now, once for all&mdash;but in the hope of
discovering why she had allowed herself to be persuaded into
leaving the convent. Until I knew that, I was a prey to wretched
doubts and despondency, which even my deep-seated confidence in her
could not overcome. Fortunately I had a small sum of money in my
pocket, and I felt sure that Bontet&rsquo;s devotion to the duke
would not be proof against an adequate bribe: perhaps he would be
able to assist me in eluding the vigilance of Madame Delhasse and
obtaining speech with her daughter.</p>
<p>Bontet, detained as I supposed by the duke, had left a
kitchen-girl to attend on me; but I soon saw him come out into the
yard, carrying a letter in his hand. He walked slowly across to the
stable door, at which the face, suddenly presented and withdrawn,
had caught my attention. He stopped before the door a moment, then
the door opened. I could not see whether he opened it or whether it
was unlocked from within, for his burly frame obstructed my view;
but the pause was long enough to show that more than the lifting of
a latch was necessary. And that I thought worth notice. The door
closed after Bontet. I rose, opened my window and listened; but the
yard was broad and no sound reached me from the stable.</p>
<p>I waited there five minutes perhaps. The inn-keeper did not
reappear, so I returned to my place. I had finished my meal before
he came out. This time I was tolerably sure that the door was
closed behind him by another hand, and I fancied that I heard the
click of a lock. Also I noticed that the letter was no longer
visible&mdash;of course, he might have put it in his pocket.
Jumping up suddenly as though I had just chanced to notice him, I
asked him if he were off to Pontorson, or, if not, had he a moment
for conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going in a few minutes, sir,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;but I am at your service now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were civil enough, but his manner was surly and
suspicious. Lighting a cigarette, I sat down on the window-sill,
while he stood just outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a bedroom,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Have you one for
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given you the room on the first floor, immediately
opposite that of the duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. And where are the ladies lodged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no difficulty about giving me an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a sitting room on the first floor,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;but hitherto they have not used it. They have two
bedrooms, connected by an interior door, on the second floor, and
they have not left them since their arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the duke visited them there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has seen them. They had a
conversation on their arrival;&rdquo; and the fellow grinned.</p>
<p>Now was my time. I took a hundred-franc note out of my pocket
and held it in my hand so that he could see the figures on it. I
hoped that he would not be exorbitant, for I had but one more and
some loose napoleons in my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the conversation about?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He put out his hand for the note; but I kept my grasp on it.
Honesty was not written large&mdash;no, nor plain to read&mdash;on
Bontet&rsquo;s fat face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard little of it; but the young lady said, as they
hurried upstairs: &lsquo;Where is he? Where is
he?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I held out the note to him. He had earned it. And greedily
he clutched it, and stowed it in his breeches pocket under his
blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard no more; they hurried her up; the old lady had
her by one arm and the duke by the other. She looked
distressed&mdash;why, I know not; for I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;here a
sly grin spread over the fellow&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;that the
pretty present I saw is for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the property of the duke,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But gentlemen sometimes make presents to ladies,&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be his purpose to do so. Bontet, I want to see the
young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed insolently, kicking his toe against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use, unless you have a better present, sir? But
it&rsquo;s nothing to me. If you can manage it, you&rsquo;re
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how am I to manage it? Come, earn your money, and
perhaps you&rsquo;ll earn more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re liberal, sir;&rdquo; and he stared at me as
though he were trying to look into my pocket and see how much money
was there. I was glad that his glance was not so penetrating.
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help you. Stay, though. The old lady has
ordered coffee for two in the sitting-room, and bids me rouse the
duke when it is ready: so perhaps the young lady will be left alone
for a time. If you could steal up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not in the mood to stand on a punctilio. My brain was
kindled by Marie&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Already
I was searching for their meaning and finding what I wished. If I
could see her, and learn the longed-for truth from her, I should go
in good heart to my conflict with the duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your room,&rdquo; said Bontet, whom my prospective
<em>largesse</em> had persuaded to civility and almost to
eagerness, &ldquo;and wait. If madame and the duke go there,
I&rsquo;ll let you know. But you must risk meeting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind about that,&rdquo; said I; and, in
truth, nothing could make my relations with the pair more hostile
than they were already.</p>
<p>My business with Bontet was finished; but I indulged my
curiosity for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a good stable over there, I see,&rdquo; I
remarked. &ldquo;How many horses have you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow turned very red: all signs of good humor vanished
from his face; my bribe evidently gave me no right to question him
on that subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no horses there,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;The
horses are in the new stable facing the road. This one is
disused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw you come out from there, and I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep some stores there,&rdquo; he said sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s kept locked?&rdquo; I
asked at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely, sir,&rdquo; he replied. But his uneasy air
confirmed my suspicions as to the stable. It hid some secret, I was
sure. Nay, I began to be sure that my eyes had not played me false,
and that I had indeed seen the face I seemed to see. If that were
so, friend Bontet was playing a double game and probably enjoying
more than one paymaster.</p>
<p>However, I had no leisure to follow that track, nor was I much
concerned to attempt the task. The next day would be time&mdash;if
I were alive the next day: and I cared little if the secret were
never revealed. It was nothing to me&mdash;for it never crossed my
mind that fresh designs might be hatched in the stable. Dismissing
the matter, I did as Bontet advised, and walked upstairs to my
room; and as luck would have it, I met Mme. Delhasse plump on the
landing, she being on her way to the sitting room. I bowed low.
Madame gave me a look of hatred and passed by me. As she displayed
no surprise, it was evident that the duke had carried or sent word
of my arrival. I was not minded to let her go without a word or
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo; I began; but she was too quick for
me. She burst out in a torrent of angry abuse. Her resentment,
dammed so long for want of opportunity, carried her away. To speak
soberly and by the card, the woman was a hideous thing to see and
hear; for in her wrath at me, she spared not to set forth in
unshamed plainness her designs, nor to declare of what rewards,
promised by the duke, my interference had gone near to rob her and
still rendered uncertain. Her voice rose, for all her efforts to
keep it low, and she mingled foul words of the duchess and of me
with scornful curses on the virtue of her daughter. I could say
nothing; I stood there wondering that such creatures lived, amazed
that Marie Delhasse must call such an one her mother.</p>
<p>Then in the midst of her tirade, the duke, roused without
Bontet&rsquo;s help, came out of his room, and waited a moment
listening to the flow of the torrent. And, strange as it seemed, he
smiled at me and shrugged his shoulders, and I found myself smiling
also; for disgusting as the woman was, she was amusing, too. And
the duke went and caught her by the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be silly, mother. We can settle our
accounts with Mr. Aycon in another way than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His touch and words seemed to sober her&mdash;or perhaps her
passion had run its course. She turned to him, and her lips parted
with a smile, a cunning and&mdash;if my opinion be
asked&mdash;loathsome smile; and she caressed the lapel of his coat
with her hand. And the duke, who was smoking, smoked on, so that
the smoke blew in her face, and she coughed and choked: whereat the
duke also smiled. He set the right value on his instrument, and
took pleasure in showing how he despised her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, dear duke, I have such news for you&mdash;such
news?&rdquo; she said, ignoring, as perforce she must, his
rudeness. &ldquo;Come in here, and leave that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the duke suddenly bent forward, his scornful, insolent
toleration giving place to interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; he cried, and he drew her toward the door to
which she had been going, neither of them paying any more attention
to me. And the door closed upon them.</p>
<p>The duke had not needed Bontet&rsquo;s rousing. I did not need
Bontet to tell me that the coast was clear. With a last alert
glance at the door, I trod softly across the landing and reached
the stairs by which Mlle. Delhasse had descended. Gently I mounted,
and on reaching the top of the flight found a door directly facing
me. I turned the handle, but the door was locked. I rattled the
handle cautiously&mdash;and then again, and again. And presently I
heard a light, timid, hesitating step inside; and through the door
came, in the voice of Marie Delhasse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I answered at once, boldly, but in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I. Open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, in her turn, knew my voice; for the door was opened, and
Marie Delhasse stood before me, her face pale with weariness and
sorrow, and her eyes wide with wonder. She drew back before me, and
I stepped in and shut the door, finding myself in a rather large,
sparely furnished room. A door opposite was half-open. On the bed
lay a bonnet and a jacket which certainly did not belong to
Marie.</p>
<p>Most undoubtedly I had intruded into the bedchamber of that
highly respectable lady, Mme. Delhasse. I can only plead that the
circumstances were peculiar.</p>

<p><span class="hide">F</span>or a moment Marie Delhasse stood
looking at me; then she uttered a low cry, full of relief, of
security, of joy; and coming to me stretched out her hands,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here then, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charmed to see how she greeted me, I had not the heart to tell
her that her peril was not past; nor did she give me the
opportunity, for went on directly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are wounded? But not badly, not badly, Mr.
Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I was wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the duke. He said that you had been shot by a thief,
and were very badly hurt; and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped,
blushing.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; I remembered the words; my forecast
of their meaning had been true.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did what he told you,&rdquo; I asked softly,
&ldquo;make you leave the convent and come to find me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, taking courage and meeting my
eyes. &ldquo;And then you were not here, and I thought it was a
trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right; it was a trap. I came to find you at the
convent, but you were gone: only by the chance of meeting with a
friend who saw the duke&rsquo;s carriage standing here have I found
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were seeking for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was seeking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke slowly, as though hours were open for our talk; but
suddenly I remembered that at any moment the old witch might
return. And I had much to say before she came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie&mdash;&rdquo; I began eagerly, never thinking that
the name she had come to bear in my thoughts could be new and
strange from my lips. But the moment I had uttered it I perceived
what I had done, for she drew back further, gazing at me with
inquiring eyes, and her breath seemed arrested. Then, answering the
question in her eyes, I said simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what else am I here, Marie?&rdquo; and I caught her
hand in my left hand.</p>
<p>She stood motionless, still silently asking what I would. And I
kissed her hand. And again the low cry, lower still&mdash;half a
cry and half a sigh&mdash;came from her, and she drew timidly
nearer to me; and I drew her yet nearer, whispering, in a broken
word or two, that I loved her.</p>
<p>But she, still dazed, looked up at me, whispering, &ldquo;When,
when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I could not tell her when I had come to love her, for I did
not know then&mdash;nor can I recollect now; nor have I any opinion
about it, save that it speaks ill for me that it was not when first
I set my eyes upon her. But she doubted, remembering that I had
seemed fancy-struck with the little duchess, and cold, maybe stern,
to her; and because, I think, she knew that I had seen her tempted.
And to silence her doubts, I kissed her lips. She did not return my
kiss, but stood with wondering eyes. Then in an instant a change
came over her face. I felt her press my hand, and for an instant or
two her lips moved, but I heard no words, nor do I think that the
unheard words were for my ear; and I bowed my head.</p>
<p>Yet time pressed. Again I collected my thoughts from this sweet
reverie&mdash;wherein what gave me not least joy was the perfect
trust she showed in me, for that is perhaps the one thing in this
world that a man may be proud to win&mdash;and said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie, you must listen. I have something to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll take me away from them?&rdquo; she
cried, clutching my hand in both of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;You must be
brave. Listen: if I try to take you away now, it may be that I
should be killed and you left defenseless. But this evening you can
be safe, whatever befalls me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what should befall you?&rdquo; she asked, with a
swift movement that brought her closer to me.</p>
<p>I had to tell her the truth, or my plan for her salvation would
not be carried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night I fight the duke. Hush! hush! Yes, I must fight
with the duke&mdash;yes, wounded arm, my darling, notwithstanding.
We shall leave here about five and go down to the bay toward the
Mount, and there on the sands we shall fight. And&mdash;listen
now&mdash;you must follow us, about half an hour after we have
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will not let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go you must. Marie, here is a pistol. Take it; and if
anyone stops you, use it. But I think none will; for the duke will
be with me, and I do not think Bontet will interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as strong as she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll come. You&rsquo;ll be on the sands;
I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo; The help she had found in me made her brave
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get there as we are fighting or soon after. Do
not look for me or for the duke, but look for two gentlemen whom
you do not know, they will be there&mdash;French officers&mdash;and
to their honor you must trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am alive and well, I shall not fail you; but if I
come not, go to them and demand their protection from the duke,
telling them how he has snared you here. And they will not suffer
him to carry you off against your will. Do you see? Do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see. But must you fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I must fight. The duke will not trouble you
again, I think, before the evening; and if you remember what I have
told you, all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I tried to comfort her, believing as I did that no two French
gentlemen would desire or dare to refuse her their protection
against the duke. But she was clinging to me now, in great distress
that I must fight&mdash;and indeed I had rather have fought at
another time myself&mdash;and in fresh terror of her mother&rsquo;s
anger, seeing that I should not be there to bear it for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have had a terrible
quarrel just before you came. I told her that unless I saw you
within an hour nothing but force should keep me here, and that if
they kept me here by force, I would find means to kill myself; and
that I would not see nor speak to the duke unless he brought me to
you, according to his promise; and that if he sent his necklace
again&mdash;for he sent it here half an hour ago&mdash;I would not
send it back as I did then, but would fling it out of the window
yonder into the cattle pond, where he could go and fetch it out
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And my dearest Marie, finding increased courage from reciting
her courageous speech, and from my friendly hearing of it, raised
her voice, and her eyes flashed, so that she looked yet more
beautiful; and again did I forget inexorable time. But it struck me
that there was small wonder that Mme. Delhasse&rsquo;s temper had
not been of the best nor calculated to endure patiently such a
vexatious encounter as befell her when she ran against me on the
landing outside her door.</p>
<p>Yet Marie&rsquo;s courage failed again; and I told her that
before we fought I would tell my second of her state, so that if
she came not and I were wounded (of worse I did not speak), he
would come to the inn and bring her to me. And this comforted her
more, so that she grew calmer, and, passing from our present
difficulties, she gave herself to persuading me (nor would the poor
girl believe that I needed no persuading) that in no case would she
have yielded to the duke, and that her mother had left her in wrath
born of an utter despair that Marie&rsquo;s will in the matter
could ever be broken down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I told her,&rdquo; Marie repeated, &ldquo;that I
would sooner die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and raising her eyes to mine, said to me (and here I
think courage was not lacking in her):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, although once I had hesitated, now I had rather die.
For when I hesitated, God sent you to my door, that in love I might
find salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I do not know that a man does well to describe all that
passes at times like this. There are things rather meet to be left
dwelling in his own heart, sweetening all his life, and causing him
to marvel that sinners have such joys conceded to them this side of
Heaven; so that in their recollection he may find, mingling with
his delight, an occasion for humility such as it little harms any
of us to light on now and then.</p>
<p>Enough then&mdash;for the telling of it; but enough in the
passing of it there was not nor could be. Yet at last, because
needs must when the devil&mdash;or a son&mdash;aye, or an elderly
daughter of his&mdash;drives, I found myself outside the door of
Mme. Delhasse&rsquo;s room. With the turning of the lock Marie
whispered a last word to me, and full of hope I turned to descend
the stairs. For I had upon me the feeling which, oftener perhaps
than we think, gave to the righteous cause a victory against odds
when ordeal of battle held sway. Now, such a feeling is, I take it,
of small use in a court of law.</p>
<p>But Fortune lost no time in checking my presumption by an
accident which at first gave me great concern. For, even as I
turned away from the door of the room, there was Mme. Delhasse
coming up the stairs. I was fairly caught, there was no doubt about
it; and for Marie&rsquo;s sake I was deeply grieved, for I feared
that my discovery would mean another stormy scene for her.
Nevertheless, to make the best of it, I assumed a jaunty air as I
said to Mlle. Delhasse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke will be witness that you were not in your room,
madame. You will not be compromised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I fully expected that an outburst of anger would follow on this
pleasantry of mine&mdash;which was, I confess, rather in the taste
best suited to Mme. Delhasse than in the best as judged by an
abstract standard&mdash;but to my surprise the old creature did
nothing worse than bestow on me a sour grin. Apparently, if I were
well-pleased with the last half-hour, she had found time pass no
less pleasantly. All traces of her exasperation and ill humor had
gone, and she looked as pleased and contented as though she had
been an exemplary mother, rewarded (as such deserve to be) by
complete love and peace in her family circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been slinking in behind my back, have
you?&rdquo; she asked, but still with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been rude to force an entrance to your
face,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;ve been making love to the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the proper time, madame,&rdquo; said I, with much
courtesy, &ldquo;I shall no doubt ask you for an interview with
regard to that matter. I shall omit no respect that you
deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke, I stood on one side to let her pass. I cannot make
up my mind whether her recent fury or her present good humor
repelled me more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have a fine fool for a wife,&rdquo; said she,
with a jerk of her thumb toward the room where the daughter
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be compensated by a very clever
mother-in-law,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The old woman paused for an instant at the top of the stairs,
and looked me up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you men think yourselves
mighty clever, but a woman gets the better of you all now and
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was utterly puzzled by her evident exultation. The duke could
not have consented to accept her society in place of her
daughter&rsquo;s; but I risked the impropriety and hazarded the
suggestion to Mme. Delhasse. Her face curled in cunning wrinkles.
She seemed to be about to speak, but then she shut her lips with a
snap, and suspicion betrayed itself again in her eyes. She had a
secret&mdash;a fresh secret&mdash;I could have sworn, and in her
triumph she had come near to saying something that might have cast
light on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your daughter did not
expect my coming.&rdquo; It was perhaps a vain hope, but I thought
that I might save Marie from a tirade.</p>
<p>The old woman shrugged her shoulders, and observed
carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool may do what she likes;&rdquo; and with this she
knocked at the door.</p>
<p>I did not wait to see it opened&mdash;to confess the truth, I
felt not sure of my temper were I forced to see her and Marie
together&mdash;but went downstairs and into my own room. There I
sat down in a chair by the window close to a small table, for I
meant to write a letter or two to friends at home, in case the
duke&rsquo;s left hand should prove more skillful than mine when we
met that evening. But, finding that I could hardly write with my
right hand and couldn&rsquo;t write at all with the other, I
contented myself with scrawling laboriously a short note to Gustave
de Berensac, which I put in my pocket, having indorsed on it a
direction for its delivery in case I should meet with an accident.
Then I lay back in my chair, regretting, I recollect, that, as my
luggage was left at Avranches, I had not a clean shirt to fight in;
and then, becoming drowsy, I began to stare idly along the road in
front of the window, rehearsing the events of the last few days in
my mind, but coming back to Marie Delhasse.</p>
<p>So an hour passed away. Then I rose and stretched myself, and
gave a glance out of the window to see if we were likely to have a
fine evening for our sport, for clouds had been gathering up all
day. And when I had made up my mind that the rain would hold off
long enough for our purpose, I looked down at the road again, and
there I saw two figures which I knew. From the direction of
Pontorson came Jacques Bontet the inn-keeper, slouching along and
smoking a thin black cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! he has been to deliver the note to our friends the
officers,&rdquo; said I to myself.</p>
<p>And then I looked at the other familiar figure, which was that
of Mme. Delhasse. She wore the bonnet and cloak which had been
lying on the bed in her room at the time of my intrusion. She was
just leaving the premises of the inn strolling, nay dawdling,
along. She met Bontet and stopped for a moment in conversation with
him. Then she pursued her leisurely walk in the direction of
Pontorson, and I watched her till she was about three hundred yards
off. But her form had no charms, and, growing tired of the
prospect, I turned away remarking to myself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the old lady wants just a little stroll before
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did I see any reason to be dissatisfied with either of my
inferences&mdash;at the moment. So I disturbed myself no more, but
rang the bell and ordered some coffee and a little glass of the
least bad brandy in the inn. For it could not be long before I was
presented with the Duke of Saint-Maclou&rsquo;s compliments and an
intimation that he would be glad to have my company on a walk in
the cool of the evening.</p>

<p><span class="hide">S</span>lowly the afternoon wore away. My
content had given place to urgent impatience, and I longed every
moment for the summons to action. None came; and a quarter to five
I went downstairs, hoping to find some means of whiling away the
interval of time. Pushing open the door of the little
<em>salle-&agrave;-manger</em>, I was presented with a back view of
my host M. Bontet, who was leaning out of the window. Just as I
entered, he shouted &ldquo;Ready at six!&rdquo; Then he turned
swiftly round, having, I suppose, heard my entrance; at the same
moment, the sound of a door violently slammed struck on my ear
across the yard. I moved quickly up to the window. The stable door
was shut; and Bontet faced me with a surly frown on his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be ready at six?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some refreshments for Mme. Delhasse,&rdquo; he answered
readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You order refreshments from the stable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was shouting to the scullery: the door is, as you will
perceive, sir, there to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I knew that this was a lie, and I might very likely have
said as much, had not the Duke of Saint-Maclou at this moment come
into the room. He bowed to me, but addressed himself to Bontet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are the gentlemen to be here at five?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Bontet, with an air of relief, began an explanation. One of the
gentlemen&mdash;M. de Vieuville, he believed&mdash;had read out the
note in his presence, and had desired him to tell the duke that he
and the other gentleman would meet the duke and his friend on the
sands at a quarter to six. They would be where the road ceased and
the sand began at that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to think,&rdquo; Bontet explained, &ldquo;that
less attention would thus be directed to the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The precaution seemed wise enough; but why had M. de Vieuville
taken Bontet so much into his confidence? The same thought struck
the duke, for he asked sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he read the note to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he thought nothing of that,&rdquo; said Bontet
easily. &ldquo;The gentlemen at Pontorson know me very well:
several affairs have been arranged from this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to keep a private cemetery,&rdquo; said the
duke with a grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sands are there,&rdquo; laughed the fellow, with a
wave of his hand.</p>
<p>Nobody appeared to desire to continue this cheerful
conversation, and silence fell upon us for some moments. Then the
duke observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bontet, I want you for a few minutes. Mr. Aycon, shall
you be ready to start in half an hour? Our friends will probably
bring pistols: failing that, I can provide you, if you have no
objection to using mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, and they left me alone. And then, having nothing better
to do, I lit a cigar, vaulted out of the window, and strolled
toward the stable. My curiosity about the stable had been growing
rapidly. I cast a glance round, and saw nobody in the yard. Then,
with a careless air, I turned the handle of the door. Nothing
occurred. I turned it more violently; still nothing happened. I
bent down suddenly and looked through the keyhole. And I
saw&mdash;not a key, but&mdash;an eye! And for ten seconds I looked
at the eye. Then the eye disappeared; and I heard that little
unmistakable &ldquo;click.&rdquo; The eye had a pistol&mdash;and
had cocked it! Was that because it saw through the keyhole strange
garments, instead of the friendly bright blue of Bontet&rsquo;s
blouse? And why had the eye such a dislike to strangers? I
straightened myself again and took a walk along the length of the
stable, considering these questions and, incidentally, looking for
a window; but the only window was a clear four feet above my
head.</p>
<p>I am puzzled even now to say whether I regret not having
listened to the suspicion that was strong in my breast. Had I
forecast, in the least degree, the result of my neglecting to pay
heed to its warning, I should not have hesitated for a moment. But
in the absence of such a presage, I felt rather indifferent about
the matter. My predominant desire was to avoid the necessity of
postponing the settlement of the issue between the duke and myself;
and a delay to that must needs follow, if I took action in regard
to the stable. Moreover, why should I stir in the matter? I had a
right to waive any grievance of my own; for the rest, it seemed to
me that justice was not much concerned in the matter; the merits or
demerits of the parties were, in my view, pretty equal; and I
questioned the obligation to incur, not only the delay which I
detested, but, in all probability, a very risky adventure in a
cause which I had very little at heart.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;the eye&rdquo; could, by being &ldquo;ready at
six,&rdquo; get out of the stable while the duke and I were engaged
otherwise and elsewhere, why&mdash;&ldquo;Let him,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and go to the devil his own way. He&rsquo;s sure to get
there at last!&rdquo; So I reasoned&mdash;or perhaps, I should
rather say, so I felt; and I must repeat that I find it difficult
now to be very sorry that my mood was what it was.</p>
<p>My half hour was passing. I crossed back to the window and got
in again. The duke, whose impatience rivaled my own, was waiting
for me. A case of pistols lay on the table and, having held them up
for me to see, he slipped them inside his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready, sir?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We may as
well be starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed and motioned him to precede me. He also, in spite of his
impatience, seemed to me to be in a better humor than earlier in
the day. The interview with Mme. Delhasse must have been
satisfactory to both parties. Had not his face showed me the
improvement in his temper, his first words after we left the
premises of the inn (at a quarter past five exactly) would have
declared it; for he turned to me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Aycon. You&rsquo;re running a great risk
for nothing. Be a sensible man. Go back to Avranches, thence to
Cherbourg, and thence to where you live&mdash;and leave me to
settle my own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I accept that proposal,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
must know what &lsquo;your own affairs&rsquo; include.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making a fool of yourself&mdash;or being
made a fool of&mdash;which you please,&rdquo; he assured me; and
his face wore for the moment an almost friendly look. I saw clearly
that he believed he had won the day. The old lady had managed to
make him think that&mdash;by what artifice I knew not. But what I
did know was that I believed not a jot of the insinuation he was
conveying to me, and had not a doubt of the truth, and sincerity of
Marie Delhasse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of us do that sometimes,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;And when one has begun, it is best to go through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please. Have you ever practiced with your left
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve not long to
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To do him justice, he said it in no boasting way, but like a man
who would warn me, and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never practiced with my right either,&rdquo; I
remarked. &ldquo;I think I get rather a pull by the
arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked on in silence for a few yards. Then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re resolved on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; I returned. For I understood that he
did but offer the same terms as before&mdash;terms which included
the abandonment of Marie Delhasse.</p>
<p>On we went, our faces set toward the great Mount, and with the
sinking sun on our left hands. We met few people, and as we reached
the sands yet fewer. When we came to a stand, just where the
causeway now begins (it was not built then), nobody was in sight.
The duke took out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are punctual to the minute,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
hope those fellows won&rsquo;t be very late, or the best of the
light will be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were some large flat blocks of stone lying by the
roadside, and we sat down on them and waited. We were both smoking,
and we found little to say to one another. For my part, I thought
less of our coming encounter than of the success of the scheme
which I had laid for Marie&rsquo;s safety. And I believe that the
duke, on his part, gave equally small heed to the fight; for the
smile of triumph or satisfaction flitted now and again across his
face, called forth, I made no doubt, by the pleasant conviction
which Mlle. Delhasse had instilled into his mind, and which had
caused him to dub me a fool for risking my life in the service of a
woman who had promised all he asked of her.</p>
<p>But the sun sank; the best of the light went; and the officers
from Pontorson did not come. It was hard on six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we fight to-night, we must fight now!&rdquo; cried the
duke suddenly. &ldquo;What the plague has become of the
fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too dark for me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it soon will be for me,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Come, are we to wait till to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if
you&rsquo;ll promise not to seek to see or speak to Mlle. Delhasse
till to-morrow. Otherwise we&rsquo;ll fight tonight, seconds or no
seconds, light or no light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never understood perfectly the temper of the man, nor the
sudden gusts of passion to which, at a word that chanced to touch
him, he was subject. Such a storm caught him now, and he bounded up
from where he sat, cursing me for an insolent fellow who dared to
put him under terms&mdash;for a fool who flattered himself that all
women loved him&mdash;and for many other things which it is not
well to repeat. So that at last I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, then: you know the best place, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still muttering in fury, cursing now me, now the neglectful
seconds, he strode rapidly on to the sands and led the way at a
quick pace, walking nearly toward the setting sun. The land trended
the least bit outward here, and the direction kept us well under
the lee of a rough stone wall that fringed the sands on the
landward side. Stunted bushes raised their heads above the wall,
and the whole made a perfect screen. Thus we walked for some ten
minutes with the sun in our eyes and the murmur of the sea in our
ears. Then at a spot where the bushes rose highest the duke
abruptly stopped, saying, &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; and took the case of
pistols out of his pocket. He examined the loading, handing each in
turn to me. While this was being done neither of us spoke. Then he
held them both out, the stocks towards me; and I took the one
nearest to my hand. The duke laid the other down on the sands and
motioned me to follow his example; and he took his handkerchief out
of his pocket and wound it round his right hand, confining the
fingers closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie the knot, if you can,&rdquo; said he, holding out his
hand thus bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far I am willing to trust you,&rdquo; said I; but he
bowed ironically as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be awkward enough anyhow for the one of us that
chances to kill the other, seeing that we have no seconds or
witnesses; but it would look too black against me, if my right hand
were free while yours is in a sling. So pray, Mr. Aycon, do not
insist on trusting me too much, but tie the knot if your wounded
arm will let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engrossed with my thoughts and my schemes, I had not dwelt on
the danger to which he called my attention, and I admit that I
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to be called a murderer,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Shall we not wait again for M. de Vieuville and his
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse them!&rdquo; said he, fury in his eye again.
&ldquo;By Heavens, if I live, I&rsquo;ll have a word with them for
playing me such a trick! The light is all but gone now. Come, take
your place. There is little choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to fight, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you will leave me in peace: but if
not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back to the inn and fight to-morrow: and
meanwhile things shall stand as they are,&rdquo; said I, repeating
my offer, in the hope that he would now be more reasonable.</p>
<p>He looked at me sullenly; then his rage came again upon him, and
he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your place: stand where you like, and, in
God&rsquo;s name, be quick!&rdquo; And he paused, and then added:
&ldquo;I cannot live another night&mdash;&rdquo; And he broke off
again, and finished by crying: &ldquo;Quick! Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing there was no help for it, I took up a position. No more
words passed between us, but with a gesture he signed to me to move
a little: and thus he adjusted our places till we were opposite one
another, about two yards between us, and each presenting his side
direct to the sun, so that its slanting rays troubled each of us
equally, and that but little. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will step back five paces, and do you do the like. When
we are at the distance, do you count slowly,
&lsquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three,&rsquo; and at &lsquo;Three&rsquo;
we will fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not like having to count, but it was necessary that one of
us should; and he, when I pressed him, would not. Therefore it was
arranged as he said. And I began to step back, but for an instant
he stayed me. He was calm now, and he spoke in quiet tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even now, if you will go!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For the
girl is mine; and I think that, and not my life or death, is what
you care about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is not yours and never will be,&rdquo; said I.
But then I remembered that, the seconds not having come, my scheme
had gone astray, and that if he lived in strength, Marie would be
well-nigh at his mercy. And on that I grew stern, and the desire
for his blood came on me; and he, I think, saw it in my face, for
he smiled, and without more turned and walked to his place. And I
did the like; and we turned round again and stood facing one
another.</p>
<p>All this time my pistol had hung in the fingers of my right
hand. I took it now in my left, and looked to it, and cried to the
duke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he answered easily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I raised my arm and took my aim,&mdash;and if the aim were
not true on his heart, my hand and not my will deserves the praise
of Mercy,&mdash;and I cried aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One!&rdquo; and paused; and cried &ldquo;Two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the word left my lips&mdash;before the final fatal
&ldquo;Three!&rdquo; was so much as ready to my tongue&mdash;while
I yet looked at the duke to see that I was not taking him
unawares&mdash;loud and sharp two shots rang out at the same
instant in the still air: I felt the whizz of a bullet, as it
shaved my ear; and the duke, without a sound, fell forward on the
sands, his pistol exploding as he fell.</p>
<p>After all we had our witnesses!</p>

<p><span class="hide">F</span>or a moment I stood in amazement,
gazing at my opponent where he lay prostrate on the sands. Then,
guided by the smoke which issued from the bushes, I darted across
to the low stone wall and vaulted on to the top of it. I dived into
the bushes, parting them with head and hand: I was conscious of a
man&rsquo;s form rushing by me, but I could pay no heed to him, for
right in front of me, in the act of re-loading his pistol, I saw
the burly inn-keeper Jacques Bontet. When his eyes fell on me, as I
leaped out almost at his very feet, he swore an oath and turned to
run. I raised my hand and fired. Alas! the Duke of Saint-Maclou had
been justified in his confidence; for, to speak honestly, I do not
believe my bullet went within a yard of the fugitive. Hearing the
shot and knowing himself unhurt, he halted and faced me. There was
no time for re-loading. I took my pistol by the muzzle and ran at
him. My right arm was nearly useless; but I took it out of the
sling and had it ready, for what it was worth. I saw that the
fellow&rsquo;s face was pale and that he displayed no pleasure in
the game. But he stood his ground; and I, made wary by the
recollection of my maimed state, would not rush on him, but came to
a stand about a yard from him, reconnoitering how I might best
spring on him. Thus we rested for a moment till remembering that
the duke, if he were not already dead, lay at the mercy of the
other scoundrel, I gathered myself together and threw myself at
Jacques Bontet. He also had clubbed his weapon, and he struck
wildly at me as I came on. My head he missed, and the blow fell on
my right shoulder, settling once for all the question whether my
right arm was to be of any use or not. Yet its uselessness mattered
not, for I countered his blow with a better, and the butt of my
pistol fell full and square on his forehead. For a moment he stood
looking at me, with hatred and fear in his eyes: then, as it seemed
to me, quite slowly his knees gave way under him; his face dropped
down from mine; he might have been sinking into the ground, till at
last, his knees being bent right under him, uttering a low groan,
he toppled over and lay on the ground.</p>
<p>Spending on him and his state no more thought that they
deserved, I snatched his pistol from him (for mine was broken at
the junction of barrel and stock), and, without waiting to load
(and indeed with one hand helpless and in the agitation which I was
suffering it would have taken me more than a moment), I hastened
back to the wall, and, parting the bushes, looked over. It was a
strange sight that I saw. The duke was no longer prone on his face,
as he had fallen, but lay on his back, with his arms stretched out,
crosswise; and by his side knelt a small spare man, who searched,
hunted, and rummaged with hasty, yet cool and methodical, touch,
every inch of his clothing. Up and down, across and across, into
every pocket, along every lining, aye, down to the boots, ran the
nimble fingers; and in the still of the evening, which seemed not
broken but rather emphasized by the rumble of the tide that had
begun to come in over the sands from the Mount, his passionate
curses struck my ears. I recollect that I smiled&mdash;nay, I
believe that I laughed&mdash;for the man was my old acquaintance
Pierre&mdash;and Pierre was still on the track of the
Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace; and he had not doubted, any more than I
had doubted, that the duke carried it upon his person. Yet Pierre
found it not, for he was growing angry now; he seemed to worry the
still body, pushing it and tossing the arms of it to and fro as a
puppy tosses a slipper or a cushion. And all the while the
unconscious face of the Duke of Saint-Maclou was turned up to
heaven, and a stiff smile seemed to mock the baffled plunderer. And
I also wondered where the necklace was.</p>
<p>Then I let myself down on to the noiseless sands and stole
across to the spot where the pair were. Pierre&rsquo;s hands were
searching desperately and wildly now; he no longer expected to
find, but he could not yet believe that the search was in very
truth in vain. Absorbed in his task, he heard me not; and coming up
I set my foot on the pistol that lay by him, and caught him, as the
duke had caught Lafleur his comrade, by the nape of the neck, and
said to him, in a bantering tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is it not there, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wriggled; but the strength of the little man in a struggle at
close quarters was as nothing, and I held him easily with my one
sound hand. And I mocked him, exhorting him to look again, telling
him that everything was not to be seen from a stable, and bidding
him call Lafleur from hell to help him. And under my grip he grew
quiet and ceased to search; and I heard nothing but his quick
breathing. And I laughed at him as I plucked him off the duke and
flung him on his back on the sands, and stood looking down on him.
But he asked no mercy of me; his small eyes answered defiance back
to me, and he glanced still wistfully at the quiet man beside
us.</p>
<p>Yet he was to escape me&mdash;with small pain to me, I confess.
For at the moment a cry rang loud in my ear: I knew the voice; and
though I kept my foot on Pierre&rsquo;s pistol, yet I turned my
head. And on the instant the fellow sprang to his feet, and, with
an agility that I could not have matched, started running across
the sands toward the Mount. Before I had realized what he was
about, he had thirty yards&rsquo; start of me. I heard the water
rushing in now; he must wade deep, nay, he must swim to win the
Mount. But from me he was safe, for I was no such runner as he.
Yet, had he and I been alone, I would have pursued him. But the cry
rang out again, and, giving no more thought to him, I turned
whither Marie Delhasse, come in pursuance of my directions, stood
with a hand pointed in questioning at the duke, and the pistol that
I had given her fallen from her fingers on the sand. And she swayed
to and fro, till I set my arm round her and steadied her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you killed him?&rdquo; she asked in a frightened
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not so much as fire at him,&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;We were attacked by thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inn-keeper and another. They thought that he carried
the necklace, and tracked us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did they take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not on him,&rdquo; I answered, looking into her
eyes.</p>
<p>She raised them to mine and said simply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it not;&rdquo; and with that, asking no more, she
drew near to the duke, and sat down by him on the sand, and lifted
his head on to her lap, and wiped his brow with her handkerchief,
saying in a low voice, &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, whether it be, as some say, that the voice a man loves will
rouse him when none else will, or that the duke&rsquo;s swoon had
merely come to its natural end, I know not; but, as she spoke, he,
who had slept through Pierre&rsquo;s rough handling, opened his
eyes, and, seeing where he was, tried to raise his hand, groping
after hers: and he spoke, with difficulty indeed, yet plainly
enough, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rascals thought I had the necklace. They did not know
how kind you had been, my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started where I stood. Marie grew red and then white, and
looked down at him no longer with pity, but with scorn and anger on
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it not,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;For all
heaven, I would not touch it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she looked up to me as she said it, praying me with her eyes
to believe.</p>
<p>But her words roused and stung the duke to an effort and an
activity that I thought impossible to him; for he rolled himself
from her lap, and, raising himself on his hand, with half his body
lifted from the ground, said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it not? You haven&rsquo;t the necklace? Why,
your message told me that you would never part from it
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent no message,&rdquo; she answered in a hard voice,
devoid of pity for him; how should she pity him? &ldquo;I sent no
message, save that I would sooner die than see you
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amazement spread over his face even in the hour of his
agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to say that you would
await me to-night, and to ask for the necklace to adorn yourself
for my coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he was dying, I could hardly control myself to hear him
speak such words. But Marie, in the same calm scornful voice
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom did the message come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your mother,&rdquo; said he, gazing at her eagerly.
&ldquo;And I sent mine&mdash;the one I told you&mdash;by her.
Marie, was it not true?&rdquo; he cried, dragging himself nearer to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True!&rdquo; she echoed&mdash;and no more.</p>
<p>But it was enough. For an instant he glared at her; then he
cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old fiend has played a trick on me! She has got the
necklace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I began to understand the smile that I had seen on Mme.
Delhasse&rsquo;s face, and her marvelous good humor; and I began to
have my opinion concerning her evening stroll to Pontorson. Bontet
and Pierre had been matched against more than they thought.</p>
<p>The duke, painfully supported on his hand, drew nearer still to
Marie; but she rose to her feet and retreated a pace as he
advanced. And he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you love me, Marie? You would have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She interrupted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all men I loathe you!&rdquo; she said, looking on
him with shrinking and horror in her face.</p>
<p>His wound was heavy on him&mdash;he was shot in the stomach and
was bleeding inwardly&mdash;and had drawn his features; his pain
brought a sweat on his brow, and his arm, trembling, scarce held
him. Yet none of these things made the anguish in his eyes as he
looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the man I love,&rdquo; said she in calm
relentlessness.</p>
<p>And she put out her hand and took mine, and drew me to her,
passing her arm through mine. The Duke of Saint-Maclou looked up at
us; then he dropped his head, heavily and with a thud on the sand,
and so lay till we thought he was dead.</p>
<p>Yet it might be that his life could be saved, and I said to
Marie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay by him, while I run for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not stay by him,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you go,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Stop the first
people you meet; or, if you see none, go to the inn. And bid them
bring help to carry a wounded man and procure a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and, without a glance at him, started
running along the sands toward the road. And I, left alone with
him, sat down and raised him, as well as I could, turning his face
upward again and resting it on my thigh. And I wiped his brow. And,
after a time, he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help will be here soon,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She has
gone to bring help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full ten minutes passed slowly; he lay breathing with
difficulty, and from time to time I wiped his brow. At last he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some brandy in my pocket. Give it
me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I found the flask and gave him some of its contents, which kept
the life in him for a little longer. And I was glad to feel that he
settled himself, as though more comfortably, against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asked very faintly.</p>
<p>And I told him what had happened, as I conceived it&mdash;how
that Bontet must have given shelter to Pierre, till such time as
escape might be possible; but how that, when Bontet discovered that
the necklace was in the inn, the two scoundrels, thinking that they
might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, had determined
to make another attempt to secure the coveted spoil; how, in
pursuance of this scheme, Bontet had, as I believed, suppressed the
duke&rsquo;s message to his friends at Pontorson, with the intent
to attack us, as they had done, on the sands; and I added that he
himself knew, better than I, what was likely to have become of the
necklace in the hands of Mme. Delhasse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; I concluded, &ldquo;I doubt if Madame
will be at the inn to welcome us on our return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came to me and told me that Marie would give all I
asked, and I gave her the necklace to give to Marie; and believing
what she told me, I was anxious not to fight you, for I thought you
had nothing to gain by fighting. Yet you angered me, so I resolved
to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to have strength for nothing more; yet at the end,
before life left him, one strange last change came over him. Both
his rough passion and the terrible abasement of defeat seemed to
leave him, and his face became again the face of a well-bred,
self-controlled man. There was a helpless effort at a shrug of his
shoulders, a scornful slight smile on his lips, and a look of
recognition, almost of friendliness, almost of humor, in his eyes,
as he said to me, who still held his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mon Dieu</em>, but I&rsquo;ve made a mess of it, Mr.
Aycon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I do not know that anyone could better this epitaph which
the Duke of Saint-Maclou composed for himself in the last words he
spoke this side the grave.</p>

<p><span class="hide">W</span>hen I saw that the Duke of
Saint-Maclou was dead, I laid him down on the sands, straightening
him into a seemly posture; and I closed his eyes and spread his
handkerchief over his face. Then I began to walk up and down with
folded arms, pondering over the life and fate of the man and the
strange link between us which the influence of two women had
forged. And I recognized also that an hour ago the greater
likelihood had been that I should be where he lay, and he be
looking down on me. <em>Dis aliter visum.</em> His own sin had
stretched him there, and I lived to muse on the wreck&mdash;on the
&ldquo;mess&rdquo; as he said in self-mockery&mdash;that he had
made of his life. Yet, as I had felt when I talked to him before,
so I felt now, that his had been the hand to open my eyes, and from
his mighty but base love I had learned a love as strong and, as I
could in all honesty say, more pure.</p>
<p>The sun was quite gone now, the roll of the tide was nearer, and
water gleamed between us and the Mount. But we were beyond its
utmost rise, save at a spring tide, and I waited long, too
engrossed in my thoughts to be impatient for Marie&rsquo;s return.
I did not even cross the wall to see how Bontet fared under the
blow I had given him&mdash;whether he were dead, or lay still
stunned, or had found life enough to crawl away. In truth, I cared
not then.</p>
<p>Presently across the sands, through the growing gloom, I saw a
group approaching me. Marie I knew by her figure and gait and saw
more plainly, for she walked a little in front as though she were
setting the example of haste. The rest followed together; and,
looking past them, I could just discern a carriage which had been
driven some way on to the sands. One of the strangers wore
top-boots and the livery of a servant. As they approached, he fell
back, and the remaining two&mdash;a man and a woman on his
arm&mdash;came more clearly into view. Marie reached me some twenty
yards ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met no one till I was at the inn,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and then this carriage was driving by; and I told them that
a gentleman lay hurt on the sands, and they came to help you to
carry him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded and walked forward to meet them; for by now I knew the
man, yes, and the woman, though she wore a veil. And it was too
late to stop their approach. Uncovering my head, I stepped up to
them, and they stopped in surprise at seeing me. For the pair were
Gustave de Berensac and the duchess. He had gone, as he told me
afterward, to see the duchess, and they had spent the afternoon in
a drive, and she was going to set him down at his friend&rsquo;s
quarters in Pontorson, when Marie met them, and not knowing them
nor they her (though Gustave had once, two years before, heard her
sing) had brought them on this errand.</p>
<p>The little duchess threw up her veil. Her face was pale, her
lips quivered, and her eyes asked a trembling question. At the
sight of me I think she knew at once what the truth was: it needed
but the sight of me to let light in on the seemingly obscure story
which Marie had told, of a duel planned, and then interrupted by a
treacherous assault and attempted robbery. With my hand I signed to
the duchess to stop; but she did not stop, but walked past me,
merely asking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he badly hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught her by the arm and held her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;badly;&rdquo; and I felt her
eyes fixed on mine.</p>
<p>Then she said, gently and calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is dead,&rdquo; I answered, and loosed her
arm.</p>
<p>Gustave de Berensac had not spoken: and he now came silently to
my side, and he and I followed a pace or two behind the duchess.
The servant had halted ten or fifteen yards away. Marie had reached
where the duke lay and stood now close by him, her arms at her side
and her head bowed. The duchess walked up to her husband and,
kneeling beside him, lifted the handkerchief from his face. The
expression wherewith he had spoken his epitaph&mdash;the summary of
his life&mdash;was set on his face, so that he seemed still to
smile in bitter amusement. And the little duchess looked long on
the face that smiled in contempt on life and death alike. No tears
came in her eyes and the quiver had left her lips. She gazed at him
calmly, trying perhaps to read the riddle of his smile. And all the
while Marie Delhasse looked down from under drooping lids.</p>
<p>I stepped up to the duchess&rsquo; side. She saw me coming and
turned her eyes to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked just like that when he asked me to marry
him,&rdquo; she said, with the simple gravity of a child whose
usual merriment is sobered by something that it cannot
understand.</p>
<p>I doubted not that he had. Life, marriage, death&mdash;so he had
faced them all, with scorn and weariness and
acquiescence&mdash;all, save that one passion which bore him beyond
himself.</p>
<p>The duchess spread the handkerchief again over the dead
man&rsquo;s face, and rose to her feet. And she looked across the
dead body of the duke at Marie Delhasse. I knew not what she would
say, for she must have guessed by now who the girl was that had
brought her to the place. Suddenly the question came in a tone of
curiosity, without resentment, yet tinctured with a delicate scorn,
as though spoken across a gulf of difference:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really care for him at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie started, but she met the duchess&rsquo; eyes and answered
in a low voice with a single word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said the little duchess with a sigh;
and, if I read aright what she expressed, it was a pitying
recognition of the reason in that answer: he could not have
expected anyone to love him, she seemed to say. And if that were
so, then indeed had the finger of truth guided the duke in the
penning of his epitaph.</p>
<p>We three, who were standing round the body, seemed sunk in our
own thoughts, and it was Gustave de Berensac who went to the
servant and bade him bring the carriage nearer to where we were;
and when it was come, they two lifted the duke in and disposed his
body as well as they could. The man mounted the box, and at a
foot-pace we set out. The duchess had not spoken again, nor had
Marie Delhasse; but when I took my place by Marie the duchess
suffered Gustave to join her, and in this order we passed along.
But before we had gone far, when indeed we had but just reached the
road, we met four of the police hurrying along; and before they
came to us or saw what was in the carriage, one cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen a small spare man pass this way lately? He
would be running perhaps, or walking fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stepped forward and drew them aside, signing the carriage to
go on and to the others to follow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you all there is to be told about him, if you
mean the man whom I think you mean,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But I
doubt if you will catch him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that I told them the story briefly, and so far as it
affected the matter they were engaged upon; and they heard it with
much astonishment. For they had tracked Pierre (or Raymond Pinceau
as they called him, saying it was his true name) to Bontet&rsquo;s
stable, on the matter of the previous attempt on the necklace and
the death of Lafleur, and on no other, and did not think to hear
such a sequel as I unfolded to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you will search,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;some six
yards behind the wall, and maybe a quarter of a mile from the road,
I fancy you will find Bontet; he may have crawled a little way, but
could not far, I think. As for the Duke of Saint-Maclou, gentlemen,
his body was in the carriage that passed you this moment. And I am
at your service, although I would desire, if it be possible, to be
allowed to follow my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There being but four of them and their anxiety being to achieve
the capture of Pierre, they made no difficulty of allowing me to go
on my way, taking from me my promise to present myself before the
magistrate at Avranches next day; and leaving two to seek for
Bontet, the other two made on, in the hope of finding a boat to
take them to the Mount, whither they conceived the escaped man must
have directed his steps.</p>
<p>Thus delayed, I was some time behind the others in reaching the
inn, and I found Gustave waiting for me in the entrance. The body
of the duke had been carried to his own room and a messenger sent
to procure a proper conveyance. Marie Delhasse was upstairs, and
Gustave&rsquo;s message to me was that the duchess desired to see
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is one thing I want to
do before that;&rdquo; and I called to a servant girl who was
hovering between terror and excitement at the events of the
evening, and asked her whether Mme. Delhasse had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The lady left word
that she would be back in half an hour, but she has not yet
returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said to Gustave de Berensac, laying my hand on his
shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am married, Gustave, you will not meet my
mother-in-law in my house;&rdquo; and I left Gustave staring in an
amazement not unnatural to his ignorance. And I allowed myself to
be directed by the servant girl to where the duchess sat.</p>
<p>The duchess waited till the door was shut, and then turned to me
as if about to speak, but I was beforehand with her; and I
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for speaking of the necklace, but I fear it is
still missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess looked at me scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave it to the girl again, I suppose?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave it,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;to the girl&rsquo;s
mother, and she, I fear, has made off with it;&rdquo; and I told
the duchess how Mme. Delhasse had laid her plot. The duchess heard
me in silence, but at the end she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not matter. I would never have worn the thing
again; but it was a pretty plot between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The duke had no thought,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;but
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I meant between mother and daughter,&rdquo; said the
duchess. &ldquo;The mother gets the diamonds from my husband; the
daughter, it seems, Mr. Aycon, is likely to get respectability from
you; and I suppose they will share the respective benefits when
this trouble has blown over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no use to be angry with her; to confess the truth, I felt
that anger would come ill from me. So I did but say very
quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are wrong. Mlle. Delhasse knew nothing of her
mother&rsquo;s device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not deny all of what I say,&rdquo; observed the
duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mlle. Delhasse,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;is in no need
of what you suggest; but I hope that she will be my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some day,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;you will
see the necklace&mdash;or perhaps that would not be safe. Madame
will send the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it happens,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;on my honor, I
will write and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duchess, with a toss of her head which meant &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;m right and you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; rose from her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must take poor Armand home,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;M.
de Berensac is going with me. Will you accompany us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me a delay of one hour, I will most
willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to do in that hour, Mr. Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I purpose to escort Mlle. Delhasse back to the convent
and leave her there. I suppose we shall all have to answer some
questions in regard to this sad matter, and where can she stay near
Avranches save there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly can&rsquo;t come to my house,&rdquo; said
the duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be impossible under the circumstances,&rdquo; I
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under any circumstances,&rdquo; said the duchess
haughtily.</p>
<p>By this time a covered conveyance had been procured, and when
the duchess, having fired her last scornful remark at me, walked to
the door of the inn, the body of the duke was being placed in it.
Gustave de Berensac assisted the servant, and their task was just
accomplished when Jacques Bontet was carried by two of the police
to the door. The man was alive and would recover, they said, and be
able to stand his trial. But as yet no news had come of the fortune
that attended the pursuit of Raymond Pinceau, otherwise known as
Pierre. It was conjectured that he must have had a boat waiting for
him at or near the Mount, and, gaining it, had for the moment at
least made good his escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall find about that from Bontet,&rdquo; said one
of them, with a complacent nod at the fellow who lay still in a
sort of stupor, with blood-stained bandages round his head.</p>
<p>I stood by the door of the duchess&rsquo; carriage, in which she
and Gustave were to follow the body of the duke, and when she came
to step in I offered her my hand. But she would have none of it.
She got in unassisted, and Gustave followed her. They were about to
move off, when suddenly, running from the house in wild dismay,
came Marie Delhasse, and caring for none of those who stood round,
she seized my arm, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother is neither in the sitting room nor in her
bedroom! Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I saw no need to tell Marie at that time what had become of
Mme. Delhasse. The matter, however, was not left in my hands; no,
nor in those of Gustave de Berensac, who called out hastily to the
driver, &ldquo;Ready! Go on, go on!&rdquo; The duchess called
&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; and then she turned to Marie Delhasse and said
in calm cold tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask where your mother is. Well, then, where is the
necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie drew back as though she had been struck; yet her grip did
not leave my arm, but tightened on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The necklace?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>And the duchess, using the most scornful words she knew and
giving a short little laugh, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother has levanted with the necklace. Of course you
didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, if Marie Delhasse had been stern to the Duke of
Saint-Maclou when he lay dying, his wife avenged him to the full
and more. For at the words, at the sight of the duchess&rsquo;
disdainful face and of my troubled look, Marie uttered a cry and
reeled and sank half-fainting in my arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, drive on!&rdquo; said the Duchess of Saint-Maclou in
a wearied tone.</p>
<p>And away they drove, leaving us two alone. Nor did Marie speak
again, unless it were in distressed incoherent protests, till, an
hour later, I delivered her into the charge of the Mother Superior
at the convent by the side of the bay. And the old lady bade me
wait till she saw Marie comfortably bestowed, and then she returned
to me and we walked side by side for a while in the little
burying-ground, she listening to an outline of my story. Perhaps I,
in a lover&rsquo;s zeal, spoke harshly of the duchess; for the old
lady put her hand upon my arm and said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not for losing the diamonds that her heart was
sore&mdash;poor silly child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, inasmuch as I doubted whether my venerable friend thought
that it was for the loss of her husband either, I held my
peace.</p>

<p><span class="hide">T</span>here remains yet one strange and
terrible episode of which I must tell, though indeed, I thank God,
I was in no way a witness of it. A week after the events which I
have set down, while Marie still lay prostrate at the convent, and
I abode at my old hotel in Avranches, assisting to the best of my
power in the inquiry being held by the local magistrate, an officer
of police arrived from Havre; and when the magistrate had heard his
story, he summoned me from the ante-room where I was waiting, and
bade me also listen to the story. And this it was:</p>
<p>At the office where tickets were taken for a ship on the point
to make the voyage to America, among all the crowd about to cross,
it chanced that two people met one another&mdash;an elderly woman
whose face was covered by a thick veil, and a short spare man who
wore a fair wig and large red whiskers. Yet, notwithstanding these
disguises, the pair knew one another. For at first sight of the
woman, the man cowered away and tried to hide himself; while she,
perceiving him, gave a sudden scream and clutched eagerly at the
pocket of her dress.</p>
<p>Seeing himself feared, the ruffian took courage, his quick brain
telling him that the woman also was seeking to avoid recognition.
And when she had taken her ticket, he contrived to see the book
and, finding a name which he did not know as hers, he tracked her
to the inn where she was lodging till the vessel should start. When
he walked into the inn, she shrank before him and turned
pale&mdash;for he caught her with the veil off her face&mdash;and
again she clutched at her pocket. He sat down near her: for a while
she sat still; then she rose and walked out into the air, as though
she went for a walk. But he, suspecting rightly that she would not
return, tracked her again to another inn, meaner and more obscure
than the first, and, walking in, he sat down by her. And again the
third time this was done: and there were people who had been at
each of the inns to speak to it: and those at the third inn said
that the woman looked as though Satan himself had taken his place
by her&mdash;so full of helplessness and horror was she; while the
man smiled under alert bright eyes that would not leave her face,
except now and again for a swift watchful glance round the room.
For he was now hunter and hunted both; yet, like a dog that will be
slain rather than loose his hold, he chose to risk his own life, if
by that he might not lose sight of the unhappy woman. Two lives had
been spent already in the quest: a third was nought to him; and the
woman&rsquo;s air and clutching of her pocket had set an idea
afloat in his brain. The vessel was to sail at six the next
morning; and it was eight in the evening when the man sat down
opposite the woman in the third inn they visited&mdash;it was no
better than a drinking shop near the quays. For half an hour they
sat, and there was that in their air that made them observed.
Suddenly the man crossed over to the woman and whispered in her
ear. She started, crying low yet audibly, &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo;
But he spoke to her again; and then she rose and paid her score and
walked out of the inn on to the quays, followed by her unrelenting
attendant. It was dark now, or quite dusk; and a loiterer at the
door distinguished their figures among the passing crowd but for a
few yards: then they disappeared; and none was found who had seen
them again, either under cover or in the open air, that night.</p>
<p>And for my part, I like not to think how the night passed for
that wretched old woman; for at some hour and in some place, near
by the water, the man found her alone, and ran his prey to the
ground before the bloodhounds that were on his track could come up
with them.</p>
<p>Indeed he almost won safety, or at least respite; for the ship
was already moving when she was boarded by the police, who,
searching high and low, came at last on the spare man with the red
whiskers; these an officer rudely plucked off and the fair wig with
them, and called the prisoner by the name of Pinceau. The little
man made one rush with a knife, and, foiled in that, another for
the side of the vessel. But his efforts were useless. He was
handcuffed and led on shore. And when he was searched, the stones
which had gone to compose the great treasure of the family of
Saint-Maclou&mdash;the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace&mdash;were found
hidden here and there about him; but the setting was gone.</p>
<p>And the woman? Let me say it briefly. Great were her sins, and
not the greatest of them was the theft of the Cardinal&rsquo;s
Necklace. Yet the greater that she took in hand to do was happily
thwarted; and I pray that she found mercy when the deep dark waters
of the harbor swallowed her on that night, and gave back her body
to a shameful burial.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the quiet convent by the shores of the bay the wind of the
world, with its burden of sin and sorrow, blows faintly and with
tempered force: the talk of idle, eager tongues cannot break across
the comforting of kind voices and the sweet strains of quiet
worship. Raymond Pinceau was dead, and Jacques Bontet condemned to
lifelong penal servitude; and the world had ceased to talk of the
story that had been revealed at the trial of these men,
and&mdash;what the world loved even more to discuss&mdash;of how
much of the story had not been revealed.</p>
<p>For although M. de Vieuville, President of the Court which tried
Bontet, and father of Alfred de Vieuville, that friend of the
duke&rsquo;s who was to have acted at the duel, complimented me on
the candor with which I gave my evidence, yet he did not press me
beyond what was strictly necessary to bring home to the prisoners
the crimes of murder and attempted robbery with which they were
charged. Not till I knew the Judge, having been introduced to him
by his son, did he ask me further of the matter; and then, sitting
on the lawn of his country-house, I told him the whole story, as it
has been set down in this narrative, saving only sundry matters
which had passed between the duchess and myself on the one hand,
and between Marie Delhasse and myself on the other. Yet I do not
think that my reticence availed me much against an acumen trained
and developed by dialectic struggles with generations of criminals.
For the first question which M. de Vieuville put to me was
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the girl, Mr. Aycon? She has suffered indeed
for the sins of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But young Alfred, who was standing by, laid a hand on his
father&rsquo;s shoulder and said with a laugh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, when Mr. Aycon leaves us tomorrow, it is to visit
the convent at Avranches.&rdquo; And the old man held out his hand
to me, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the convent at Avranches then I went one bright morning in
the spring of the next year; and again I walked with the stately
old lady in the little burial ground. Yet she was a little less
stately, and I thought that there was what the profane might call a
twinkle in her eye, as she deplored Marie&rsquo;s disinclination to
become a permanent inmate of the establishment over which she
presided. And on her lips came an indubitable smile when I leaped
back from her in horror at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would be none here to throw her troubles in her
teeth,&rdquo; pursued the Mother Superior, smiling still.
&ldquo;None to remind her of her mother&rsquo;s shame; none to lay
snares for her; none to remind her of the beauty which has brought
so much woe on her; no men to disturb her life with their angry
conflicting passions. Does not the picture attract you, Mr.
Aycon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a picture,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is almost perfect.
There is but one blemish in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blemish? I do not perceive it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, madame, I cannot find anywhere in your canvas the
figure of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a laugh she turned away and passed through the arched
gateway. And I saw my friend, the little nun who had first opened
the door to me when I came seeking the duchess, pass by and pause a
moment to look at me. Then I was left alone till Marie came to me
through the gateway: and I sprang up to meet her.</p>
<p>I have been candid throughout, and I will be candid
now&mdash;even though my plain speaking strikes not at myself, but
at Marie, who must forgive me as best she may. For I believe she
meant to marry me from the very first; and I doubt whether if I had
taken the dismissal she gave, I should have been allowed to go far
on my solitary way. Indeed I think she did but want to hear me say
how that all she urged was lighter than a feather against my love
for her, and, if that were her desire, she was gratified to the
full; seeing that for a moment she frightened me, and I outdid
every lover since the world began (it cannot be that I deceive
myself in thinking that) in vehemence and insistence. So that she
reproved me, adding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hardly speak the truth in all that you say: for
at first, you know, you were more than half in love with the
Duchess of Saint-Maclou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment I was silenced. Then I looked at Marie: and I found
in her words no more a rebuke, but a provocation&mdash;aye, a
challenge to prove that by no possibility could I, who loved her so
passionately, ever have been so much as half in love with any woman
in the whole world, the Duchess of Saint-Maclou not excepted. And
prove it I did that morning in the burial ground of the convent, to
my own complete satisfaction, and thereby overcame the last doubts
which afflicted Marie Delhasse.</p>
<p>And if, in spite of that most exhaustive and satisfactory proof,
the thing proved remained not much more true than the thing
disproved&mdash;why, it is not my fault. For Love has a virtue of
oblivion&mdash;yes, and a better still: that which is past he,
exceeding in power all Olympus besides, makes as though it had
never been, never could have been, and was from the first entirely
impossible, absurd, and inconceivable. And for an instance of what
I say&mdash;if indeed a further example than my own be needed,
which should not be the case&mdash;let us look at the Duchess of
Saint-Maclou herself.</p>
<p>For, if I were half in love with the duchess, which I by no
means admit, modesty shall not blind me from holding that the
duchess was as good a half in love with me. Yet, when I had been
married to Marie Delhasse some six months, I received a letter from
my good friend Gustave de Berensac, informing me of his approaching
union with Mme. de Saint-Maclou. And, if I might judge from
Gustave&rsquo;s letter, he repudiated utterly the idea which I have
ventured to suggest concerning the duchess.</p>
<p>Two other facts Gustave mentioned&mdash;both of them, I think,
with a touch of apology. The first was that the duchess, being
unable to endure the horrible associations now indissolubly
connected with the Cardinal&rsquo;s Necklace, of which she had
become owner for the term of her life&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Won&rsquo;t she wear it?&rdquo; asked my wife at
this point: she was (as wives will) leaning over my shoulder as I
read the letter.</p>
<p>It was what I also had expected to read; but what I did read was
that the duchess, ingeniously contriving to save both her feelings
and her diamonds, had caused the stones to be set in a
tiara&mdash;&ldquo;which,&rdquo; continued Gustave (I am sure he
was much in love) &ldquo;will not have any of the unpleasant
associations connected with the necklace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the second fact? It was this&mdash;just this, though it was
wrapped up in all the roundabout phrases and softened by all the
polite expressions of friendship of which Gustave was
master,&mdash;yet just this,&mdash;that he was not in a position to
invite myself and my wife to the wedding! For the little duchess,
consistent to the end, in spite of his entreaties and protests, had
resolutely and entirely declined to receive Mrs. Aycon!</p>
<p>I finished the letter and looked up at Marie. And Marie, looking
thoughtfully down at the paper, observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always told you that she was fond of you, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, for my part, I hope that Marie&rsquo;s explanation is not
the true one. I prefer to attribute the duchess&rsquo;
refusal&mdash;in which, I may state, she steadily persists&mdash;to
some mistaken and misplaced sense of propriety; or, if that fails
me, then I will set it down to the fact that Marie&rsquo;s presence
would recall too many painful and distressing scenes, and be too
full of unpleasant associations. Thus understood, the
duchess&rsquo; refusal was quite natural and agreed completely with
what she had done in respect of the necklace&mdash;for it was out
of the question to turn the edge of the difficulty by converting
Marie into a tiara!</p>
<p>So the duchess will not receive my wife. But I forgive
her&mdash;for, beyond doubt, but for the little duchess and that
indiscretion of hers, I should not have received my wife
myself!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ingenious plot, the liveliness and spirit of the
narrative, and its readable style.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Atlantic

<p>&ldquo;A glorious story, which cannot be too warmly recommended
to all who love a tale that stirs the blood. Perhaps not the least
among its many good qualities is the fact that its chivalry is of
the nineteenth, not of the sixteenth century; that it is a tale of
brave men and true, and of a fair woman of to-day. The Englishman
who saves the king &hellip; is as interesting a knight as was
Bayard&hellip;. The story holds the reader&rsquo;s attention from
first to last.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Critic</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rattling good romance.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>N.Y.

<p>&ldquo;A highly clever performance, with little touches that
recall both Balzac and Meredith. Mr. Hope, being disinclined to
follow any of the beaten tracks of romance writing, is endowed with
exceeding originality.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tragic undercurrent but increases the charm of the
pervading wit and humor of the tale, which embodies a study of
character as skillful and true as anything we have lately had, but
at the same time so simple and unpretentious as to be very welcome
indeed amid the flood of inartistic analysis which we are compelled
to accept in so many recent novels.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Philadelphia

<p>&ldquo;Her accounts of these (an anti-slavery fair and the trial

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
